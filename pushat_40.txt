Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes
The cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
The Spider joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop

Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
I'll start it at the home front, "I'm On One"
Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run; that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
If we all go to Hell, it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
I got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six
Surgical summer with it—snip, snip, snip
And you don't really want it with him

(W-W-W-What is it?)

Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder it's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by that nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got they mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cuttin' school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and an arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, "If he dies, he dies"
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwin' punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon Red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dyin', dead, yuugh

You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my mama's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother cryin'
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealin' it
Hit the pipe and start feelin' it
Ooh-wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, jeez louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took an L, started sellin' soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusin' his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Son, how come you think you'll be my connect?"
I said, "Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smokin' is my profession, let's get it

You better change, ch-change, ch-change, ch-change

Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?

The game's fucked up
Niggas’ beats is bangin', nigga, ya hooks did it
The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin’
The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until "Annie"
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy
'Cause I'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)
Ferrari, my 40th, blew the candles out
Tom Brady’d you niggas, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now it’s okay to kill Baby?
Niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby
Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure
He see what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Flash without the fire
Another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I'm the liar?
Shit, I’ve been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire
Now who do you admire?
Your rap songs is all tryin' my patience
Them prices ain't real without inflation
I done flew it, I done grew it, been a conduit
Moynat bags on my bitches, I done blew it
See through it, neck, igloo it
Habla en español, I "y tu" it
Let Steven talk streamin' and Shazam numbers
I'll ensure that you gettin' every gram from us
Let's cram numbers, easily
The only rapper sold more dope than me was Eazy-E
How could you ever right these wrongs
When you don't even write your songs?

Beef is best served like steak: well done
Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours

Them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Throwing that flag up running around you hot shit
Taking half of everything you get
Yeah them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
And we know that

Contract all fucked up
I guess that means you all fucked up
You signed to one nigga that signed to another nigga
That's signed to three niggas, now that's bad luck
Damn that shit even the odds now
You better off selling this hard now
You call it living out your dreams
You can't fly without your wings
You get it
Jeremy Scott's all camouflaged
You can't hide it from yourselves, career sabotaged
I was really in that Travelodge
You just lying through your catalogues
Where the blood and the battle scars
We the ones that judge juggling the gavels on
Put me to the body, nigga
First 48 put us to them bodies, nigga
Round here we don't play that
A to the K that, spray that, lay back
You can keep your beats, nigga
We'd much rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga
3 million can't hide that
It shows in the homes I done tried that
That's why you'll never be my neighbors
Smile as you waving but we know you niggas hate us
Fuck you playing games for
Don't be scared get everything you came for
They got you talking that big shit
Little do you know we don't miss shit
Them niggas using you as a pawn
You see they never loaded they guns

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could just to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let them talk about it, mane, I'm already livin'
I risked my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, loungin' like it's a beach chair
Papa don't preach, a-all we do is just reach here
Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doin' magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high, then suck 'em dry
Before you know it, her Q7 is buzzin' by
The queen pin to the kingpin, redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins

Valentino summers and wave runners
Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug dealers anonymous
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
My brick talk is more than obvious, it’s ominous
Garages, the phantom, ghouls, ghosts and goblins
Blonde mohawk the collection I’m Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
Hat trick under my mattress
Date I stop still has an asterisk after it
After all I can make a call
I can baptize a brick
As I wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck ain't mastered this
America’s nightmare's in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin’s got a tint
And I can’t even mention what I sent or what I spent
'Cause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Life’s a bitch
A to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick
Paid in full like ’86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has less monograms, God’s got him
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home
Shatter all of your misconceptions
Hold all of them missing weapons

We been opening studios and 40/40s up

Before Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung

Every time I come around your city bling bling
My tenure took me through Virginia
Ask Teddy Riley ‘bout me

Tried to build a cell around me
Snatched my nigga Emory up
Tried to get him to tell about me
He told 12, “Gimme 12”
He told them to go to hell about me

Mules move the drums, take ‘em to different spots
We just call the shots by simply moving our thumbs

Therein lies the piece of God

Of all the things I've ever paid for
Know that it's no price tag when I wage war
It's no more to pray for, niggas get preyed on
Darken my doorstep, they told me the day's gone
You listenin', De'Von?
As I'm talkin' to your spirit, for God's sakes
I'm dealin' with heartbreak
Checkin' my ego, I'm livin' with lost faith
I'm backin' this hit, nigga, you ever seen Shark Tank?
I paid 'em in small bills, all of 'em small face
I bet when we draw blood, you niggas will draw a blank
Dress you in all black, partnered with All Saints
Our numbers is all facts, my shooters give all thanks
And all praise, no jail bars can save
Leave you like Malcolm where X marks your grave
Hey, it's probably better this way
It's cheaper when the chaplain prays

These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl, you different
When you're not around, it feels like something's missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell no lie

Who'd have thought I would've fucked with ya

Never imagined being stuck with you
Years later, we in the villa suites
Top back, we on vanilla seats
Reminiscing about my episodes
With them extra hoes, but you didn't cheat
Cold nights when you couldn't sleep
Celine bags were the given treat
C-Class helped you see past
All them other hoes, and that they niggas weak
Whoo! I'm good money
Got you talking in dollar signs
It's all good that she the top bitch
But she just wanna know the bottom line
I don't blame her, I don't change her
I just sit back and give her options
Phillip Lim, Derek Lam
Every baller gotta know she's sponsored
Whoo! You earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turnt up, we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back

Just gotta make sure you meet all mine
Standing there staring, with your bow-legged stance
Trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
Hustle in the hood, strong with the bands
Look at you as something more than a ho I could smash
Or being something bad I could bone at the bag
Pole in my pants standing at attention
When you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
Glance at the ceiling
Now your glass is empty
Thinking backwards, really
I done grabbed a vixen
That supposed to be a fitter after video
Stacks'll really blow
Dancers get exposed
Missing you when you not around
We text each other when out of town
You remain the same no matter up or down
These other women stay pretending
Money come and they help us spend it
But'll fuck my niggas in the very minute
I was down and out and had to go to prison
Kinda high role play, acki
And again I say I like these hoes14Embed

Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in 'em
In elevator condos, on everything I love

This ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
This lifestyle's forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made 'em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
Get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race

These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

To all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae
This is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
Stood on every couch, in the A at the black party
No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours
We can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold

Who grew up on legends from outta Yonkers
Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out
Might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
The message in this music, all my niggas had to live out

Never trust a bitch who finds love in a camera
She will fuck you, then turn around and fuck a janitor
Set the parameters
You either with the pro ballers or the amateurs
I won't let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid
Good mornin', Matt Lauer—can I live?
Look at my new digs
The rooftop can host a paint-and-sip for, like, forty
The Warhols on my wall paint a war story
Had to find other ways to invest
'Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks
It's a nightmare, yeah
I'm too rare amongst all of this pink hair, ooh!
Still do the Fred Astaire on a brick
Tap-tap, throw the phone if you hear it click
Art Basel-in' the bezel
Your bustdown is bust-down and don't match the metal
Lower level's where you settle at
I'm the pot callin' the kettle black
Where there's no brake pedals at
Between God and where the Devil's at
Had to double-dutch and double back
Then hopscotch through where the trouble's at
Exactly what the game's been missin'
This fire burns hot as Hell's Kitchen

Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

Yuugh, I drops every blue moon
To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube
I am more U2, I am like Bono with the Edge
In Mexico, fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it, the wrist is magic
The left is Patek, Philippe's replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature
Unless it’s getting played on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Can’t you see my Total; Pam, Kima, Keisha
I’m aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals?
And rap niggas broke like them, they’re mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like, interior gauze
It feels like, still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin’ pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceiling’s open, I Cross-Fit the coca
Yuugh! It’s a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox
Half a million paralleled and ain’t nothin’ rented

You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain't hearing none of that street shit
'Cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I'm a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in His image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Watercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again

Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams

Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring

Pain is joy when it cries
It's my smile in disguise
It's what makes the story chilling
Spare the women and the children
Hear the scribbles of the villain
Yuugh, this is drug dealer brilliance


Pyrex on the platter like hot sex
But my tribe don't quest like love
Came in this bitch with a mask and a glove
And a team of lawyers to run the train on a judge
It's no risk without gain
It's no trust without shame
It's no us without 'caine
Push, my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron
Trey-eight on, could've been Trayvon
But instead, I chose Avon
Powder-face like a geisha
Arm & Hammer for the breakup
Turn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup
Woo, it's a match made in heaven
All that's missing is the reverend
All that's missing is a blessing
I hope God gets the message
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rock a bunch of gold chains
And I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring31Embed

(I was dreamin' of the past)
It's levels, it's layers, so pray for the players, uh
We hollowed the walls in back of bodegas, uh
(And my heart was beatin' fast)
I got plenty, it's so many, yeah
They say, “Gimme, he got plenty, yeah"

Bruh, you niggas ain't flexin', you crampin'
My weight keepin' niggas on the bikes like Amblin
Weight loss, rent loss, scramblin' (I began to lose control)
Now pass the champagne to the champion
My niggas get money, get money, get money like Ye samplin' (I began to lose control)
Gun stutter, make the drumline like Grambling
MGM gamblin', blew a small mansion (I was dreamin' of the past)
Annoyed 'cause this bitch callin' Lanvin "Laen-ven"
Fuck who you stampin', them niggas just stand-ins (And my heart was beatin' fast)
Not me, they censor and block me
You hollerin', "Top five," I only see top me
Award shows the only way you bitches could rob me (I was dreamin' of the past)

It's levels, it's layers, so pray for the players
Clip 'em, baby, if he flinch at the price of Bottega, uh (And my heart was beatin' fast)
I got plenty, it's so many, yeah
They say, “Gimme, he got plenty, yeah"

So you gots understand there's a difference
There's window stickers and window lickers (I was dreamin' of the past)
You know the type, always tryna get in your picture
I was tryna get the dope through, in your sister (And my heart was beatin' fast)
We weren't baggin' up the work, wouldn't be no dishes
Be no Christmas, mistletoe, be no kisses
Made a way for ourselves, we ain't need no wishes, hah (I was dreamin' of the past)

It's levels, it's layers, so pray for the players, uh
We hollowed the walls in back of bodegas, uh (And my heart was beatin' fast)
I got plenty, it's so many, yeah
They say, “Gimme, he got plenty, yeah"

Walk it down like Brady, gets better with time
Didn't have to reinvent the wheel, just a better design
Critics: "He's out of his mind"; haters: "He's out of his prime" (I began to lose control)
Yet, always where the money's at like lottery signs
Still I climb, rockstar, Third Eye Blind (I began to lose control)
I was bored by these albums so it gotta be time
No reward for the latter, so it gotta be mine (I was dreamin' of the past)
Huff and Puff in the club, then I gotta be Shyne
Properties all across the board, this monopoly's mine (And my heart was beatin' fast)
'Came a minister in my prime so I gotta be Shyne
I used to watch The Fresh Prince and pray the house would be mine
Coulda bought it, but I ain't like the way the kitchen design (I was dreamin' of the past)
Born in the manger, the son of a stranger
When daddy's not home, the family's in danger (And my heart was beatin' fast)

I got plenty, it's so many, yeah
They say, “Gimme, he got plenty, yeah"11Embed

Dope is like a two-way street
The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat (Uh)
Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep
Every sparkle in the club that wasn’t ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
No reward, then what’s the risk you taking?
New bitch I been fucking might start a rap war
Won’t unveil it yet, can’t tell it yet

You young and hot, so why not?
The dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot
We can’t judge you ‘cause we ain’t hug you
We sent you off to other hoods and let them niggas fuck you
For real, we made you watch from afar
Even talked down on you, tryna dim your star
Until we seen them foreign cars pull up
And watch them pick you up
And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough
So, make us proud, make it count
Until you learn to love ‘em, make ‘em spare no amount
Make ‘em dig deeper to keep ya, knowing you deserve it
Take advantage of it when you’re worth it
Real bitches worth it

You think it’s honey dew
Whispering in my ear like a hunny do
Eyeballing every bottle that we running through
Trying to stand near, nigga damn near
Pushing bitches out the way to Instagram here
It’s no pictures, now you in your feelings
I’m a real dope boy, no stranger dealings
Bruised ego, Henny-induced Debos
Nickel bag niggas, all of a sudden Ninos

This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders, gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided, if you hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me "daddy" from a complex
'Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard, step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar

But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks

Fuck nigga with the sly talk
Miss me with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters there
You point us out just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For eleven years, we seen better years
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first Grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress

Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash
Difference 'tween me and Hova

But I'm King Push, still King Push

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die than go home
I'd rather die than go home
And I ain't leaving without my forty acres
Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money's universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real, niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaud him
Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winnin'
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinnin'
Old habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
'Cause stand-up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burn us, ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it off the plastic
Now you celebrate, motherfuckers, raise your glasses

Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always "F it"
Thirty-five years of marriage and my mama left it
You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him
The better question is, did you enjoy the dance with him?
Yuh, I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch
You know this money grew your hair out, switch
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one I care about
Place none above me, God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me, only He can judge me
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended
Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended
I was a goner, punished by karma
Called him tar baby, now he's transcending genres
The 911 came with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I'm Jordan verse the Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine, reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my forty acres, Push

Trouble times destroyed my smile

Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role, it’s easy acting like Mitch
“Paid In Full” was more than reading a script
Paid in full is really just being Rich Porter
Filling all standing orders
Would you question could I swim if you saw me walking on water?
Yeah, while every song got a rapper dance
Yuugh, I’m drug money like Dapper Dan
No retirement plans, no Derek Jeters
We all know I did it; Rodriguez
The illusion of money we don’t believe in

Dual exhausts, driving flying saucers
Diamond crosses, hang Takashi portraits
Street millionaires rub shoulders
And laugh at bitches fucking promoters
Hoping that they get noticed, still driving a Focus
What you fuck him for if you didn’t know what the goal was?
Shine, remote control blinds
That turn on the time lapse, controlled by the iPad
Ahhh, my living room rap scream crack money
I don’t trust rap niggas or rap money
See this air hole tech and get ratttttt from me
Creep up on these niggas

Niggas talking it, but ain’t living it
Two years later admitting it, all them niggas is renting shit
They ask why I’m still talking dope, why not?
The biggest rappers in the game broke, voilà
They say it’s hate, but it’s these well-dressed snakes
That learn to walk on the concrete, I just saw it and spoke to it
Yuugh, you ain’t know, you got coached through it
Wooo, the rap fans got hoaxed through it
Haaa, the whole time I sold coke through it
Nigga, and records I was Bo through it
King Push is synonymous with kingpin
Chess moves on your checkerboard, king him
Yeah, this is gun slingers and Goyard
Uh, this is O Dog in the courtyard
You wonder why I’m still here

Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger 'til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I'm the shit

Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor

Roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward–oops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain't much as theirs
And we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes
Why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch
I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes
Dope boys, gold mine
That price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame
Then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin' all y'all bitches

Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talkin' to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But, sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Now when the phone start to clickin', your words start to echo
Say you got to hang up but that man won't let go
Oh, my nigga, say it ain't so
Now we speakin' on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearin' whispers, "it ain't adding up"
Givin' you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standin' up
I never thought I'd had have to question, 'Were you man enough?'
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Tellin' all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are lookin' through me, can't you hear it in my tone?

"They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone
And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home"
"Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome"
I'm just tryna offset what he was sayin' on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointin' fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like Your Honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightnin' then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak sayin'

Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talkin' to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But, sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga
How many niggas you knew snitchin' you ain't killed, nigga?
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is gettin' stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that set in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facin', once he told me that
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So, then sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!20Embed

Every plot got a twist, when you sink a battleship
I'm confused by your list
Who are used to convince
All the mules that I sent
What I miss?
I been gettin' at these coins as I'm breakin' down a brick
Made the jump to each level, Super Mario exists
All the spoons that were bent, all the fumes through the vents
I don't care what they do, this ain't that, that ain't this
I'm the trap, I'm the fix, I'm the broker, I'm The Joker
In the deck, Arthur Fleck, when he's pissed, triple six
I accepted you the lie
All the times, selfish, thinking you was mine
I showed up, then you arrived, I thought I could turn the tides
How I make it through the Chi', get to you, and almost die?
Finally tired of comin' and goin', make up your mind
I ain't come to pick up the kids to pick a fight
Goin' off all of the time, showin' off all of the time
Pushing me over the edge, don't know if I'm fallin' or flyin'
How many nights I pray, how many times?
No matter what we say, God will decide, God will decide
Call the divine, stars will align, stars will align
Love my mama, but sometimes, dad was right
Take His hand, hold on with all of your might
When you're lost in the light, call on the light

They're gonna die
Why would I wanna?

We was out in Brambleton after Pooh got hit
Club Entourage in that new drop six
Ice that'll snag any new hot bitch
Champagne super soaker screamin', "Who got this?"
Beach niggas wanted work that they could move out quick
But my Norfolk niggas, they was on some shoot-out shit
You and I, we were different like the two got mixed
Buyin' biggies, but was ridin' on some 2Pac shit
(Why would I wanna?)
We was both hurt when we see how Q dropped Bish'
Said we knew the ledge better, we thе new plot twist
Who knew your face bеin' all across the news outlets
Would mean forever I would never talk to you 'bout shit?
Huh

Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now, the past is your go-to now?
Shit, we really used to roll around
Coppin' quarter pounds, from the border towns
And shit, Ferraris gettin' ordered now
Can't water down, godfathers to you daughters now
Shit, but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now, niggas need to tone it down
(Why would I wanna?)

You would pay sixteen, I would pay eighteen
When I paid twenty-two, still was a great thing
Laid up countin' a million, we daydream
Till the plug took back his half, that's they change
Who was with you roaming the halls at night pacing?
'Cause the feds watching them things that we chasing
Sliding doors just like the van on A-Team
Revolvin' doors on them whores, they playthings
It was much more than foreigns that we were racing
If the past catch your dash, no erasing
Black 'Rari, white hood, make it a race thing
Who knew our dynasty would end up a Jay/Dame thing?
Huh

Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now, the past is your go-to now?
Shit, we really used to roll around
Coppin' quarter pounds, from the border towns
And shit, Ferraris gettin' ordered now
Can't water down, godfathers to you daughters now
Shit, but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now, niggas need to tone it down
(Why would I wanna?)
It was sad watching dude in Vlad interviews
Really it's 'bout me, he channeled it through you
Had a million answers, didn't have a clue
Why Michael kissed Fredo in Godfather II
Names they concealed, I don't make up shit
This that no-witnesses-wrapped-in-duct-tape shit
Needed all my niggas just to move your brick
That had me on Brambleton back when Pooh got hit
Huh

Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now, the past is your go-to now?
Shit, we really used to roll around
Coppin' quarter pounds, from the border towns
And shit, Ferraris gettin' ordered now
Can't water down, godfathers to you daughters now

Yeah
I just ordered one, my nigga
Yeah

I'm still a snow-mover, blow harder than tuba
Designated shooters, turn weed to woolers
Condo in Atlanta, money counters like the NASDAQ
In that glass back, the motor is the asscrack
I'm still feeding divas like I feed the meter
Holy father to 'em—I ain't talking Jesus, neither
Balance on the scale—I ain't a Libra, either
I'm just a name and a number with the means to reach you
Grim Reaper, him cheaper, hemp chiefer
His army: MCM on gym sneakers
You knowin' that hymn better, he been preaching
You motherfuckers is bloodsuckers—you been leeching
Been Baller, been Jacob, been dealer
Been realer; pound sign, been triller
All killer, no filler—been iller
Fraud niggas, you Zoolander: Ben Stiller

When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breakin' codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back-flippin' niggas—that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga—fuck out my way

Big difference between a renter and a homeowner
Hip Hop Weekly cover and a Rolling Stoner
Lufthansa: I heist, nigga, or that bitch Winona
Stop comparing me to rappers 'cause they in their moment
Might have crossed the name brand every blue
But these brand names to a brand owner isn't new
Don't make us equal 'cause we shared a bitch or two
She ain't the angel that you think—she reincarnated, too
I build mine off fed time and dope lines
You caught steam off headlines and co-signs
Young niggas cliquing up with my rivals
Like the Bible don't burn, like these bullets don't spiral
Like I can't see the scenes that you mirror in your idol
But a pawn’s only purpose is completely suicidal
Ooh, suicide, it's a suicide
I'm just talkin' to the world like it's you and I

When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breakin' codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back-flippin' niggas—that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga—fuck out my way
Nothing but cash here; this sweater's a cashmere
The roof is a translucent—it's nothin' but glass there
The car is a concept—what's next is my last year
My future is bright-hot; you never can last here
I'm top five—listen, who hot in the past year?
Five heartbeats, and I'm feelin' like Flash here
'Cause what I captured is the beast unleashed in the pasture
Story of the sheep and the wolves I unmaster
Fifty in the liquor, unwrapped 'em
Unpacked; powder rise and it falls, like Sebastian—
Telfair; tailor-made suits, handcrafted
Over Bottega Veneta, high-tops unfastened
S550 drop-top is unimaginable
To my hand drop, and then, he unattached it
Practice it, nigga, brick, break down, breakdance
Crab-walk, backspin, tanner than my Black skin
When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breakin' codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back-flippin' niggas—that go for rappers the same

Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want (Uh)
Boy, let me love you

I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?
It comes with the territory when you buzzin'
A ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging?
I ain't trying to guide you, hand on Bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
Thirty-dollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke, so
No cuffing, no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone, she's just bluffin'
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothing

Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want

All the ones I sponsored clear my conscience
Can't commit the crime without accomplice
We both to blame, let's push the shame behind us
On the DL, pushin' my brother's CL
Meet you at the spot, you had tint on the TL
It's only right you shake them phony types
And embrace the kid, like my bracelets did
Uh, I'm from the era where the money come fast
Blow it all 'cause the money don't last
All them broke niggas lookin' puppy-dog sad
She in that new purse, sayin', "Honey, don't ask"

This shit I wrote quick
Shit I hate
Broke niggas, that always got something to say
Got some nerve to have an opinion
Renegades

I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter

There's a meaning to the kissin' of the ring
The gods don't mingle with the mortals
Peasants ain't sittin' with the kings
Goliath ain't worried 'bout your sling
And Cassius ain't bothered by your swings
You niggas keep rappin' 'bout your dreams, my reality
50 birds waitin' in the wings
Do it my way, I hit the highway with the batter
So when Kanye go on his hia', it don't matter
Since you talking 'bout me, then let's talk about this money
Let's talk about the cars and why mines shaped funny
Lets' talk about the fact you'll never take nothin' from me
Lets talk about the fact you niggas hate I'm up and runnin'
RG3 nigga, be that
Runnin' through this money and these white women
Spike Lee see that
She gotta have it and I gotta give it
And you do not relate cause you niggas do not live it, no

Attention seekers beware, I will grant wishes
We can take this so much further than your mentions
I can get your eulogy on YouTube for instance
Have the whole world view the body
Since y'all claim I'm Illuminati, tell me why would you try me?
Kennedy, John F., or Bobby
Almost caught Reagan, but they stopped us at the lobby
And that was broad day, so how the fuck you gon' stop me?
You lil' niggas just dirty mine's is Zero Dark Thirty
Mine is night vision, witch huntin', ride for Pac worthy
I'm coke boy leanin' on you niggas
If money talk then I must be screamin' on you niggas
Top of the pile I was two thirds away
I was sidetracked busy selling two birds a day, God
Death is just a U-turn away
Two men ten paces then you turn and spray
I don't give a fuck what you say about me

‘Cause, darling, I pray for you
I pray for you, mmm

I, you, ooh

Rarely do you see the Phoenix rise from the ashes
Lightnin' struck twice on four classics
Self-preservation, we separate ourselves from the plastic
The ankle of my sweat still elastic, still do gymnastics
If Hov's still forever young
Then I'ma somersault backwards through these chapters
Land in thе soft-white, cook it till it's off-white
They quеstionin' my scorecard, hold it to a torch light
I hid it in the porch light, see, I had the foresight
My 9-1-1 was pullin' up to matchin' Porsche night, ooh
The married drug dealer, even named my son Brixx
He raps what he lives, so fuck the nanny, gon' sit
It's the grown man in me
Searchin' for the plug, that's the nomad in me
Still the X factor, that's the Rohan in me
Reluctantly a role model
That drowned in too many gold bottles
Harold Melvin without the Blue Notes
The past ten years, screamin', "Uno"
Then side step back into the duo
The kings of the Pyrex
I'm my brother's keeper if you listen and you dissect
All I talk is money if you listen to my dialect
Bitch, I shot "Grindin'" in my momma's momma's projects

Belong on Rushmore just from chiselin' a brick
Still fightin' demons, see, that curse is now my gift
Secrets die with me, that's as deep as the abyss, that is no coincidence
When I was in the mix, opened up your nose like I'm cuttin' it with Vicks
Slavin' over stoves like I rub together sticks
Paved another road so my soul would coexist
But Heaven only knows, I won't dig another ditch
In a suit and tie, like you puttin' on the ritz
Three record deals show me ignorance was bliss
Tryna milk a game that is only two percent
X told you Hell is hot, I told you, "Repent"
Faith never waivered as I walked along the fence
Faith moves mountains, so what are you up against?
Watch my brother 'round you bitches, I know he pretends
I greet you with the love of God, that don't make us friends
I might whisper in his ear, "Bury all of them"
Light another tiki torch and carry it again
Back up on my high horse, it's chariots again
Put the ring back on her finger, marry it again

The number don't change, I know who the chemist is
Brick by brick, we kept open dealerships
Mitch by mitch, we built up our villages
Seein' you rappers apply for the stimulus
Livin' a lie, but die for your images
It's guns involved like cowboys and Indians
You Trackhawk niggas are not my equivalent
Flew your bitch to Cuba for the thrill of it
But I ain't go, to show you what you shoulda did
Tennis chains to hide all my blemishes
My Jokеr smile, you know who the villain is (Hahahahaha!)
Just so you remеmber who you dealin' with
Look outside, the landscape ridiculous
Motion lights surrounded meticulous
Architectural Digest my premises
She just spent a million on the finishes
Millionaires were made out of middlemen
That hole in the attic was not for a ceiling fan
Army Celine, the wardrobe is militant
And army fatigue when I talk pyramids
Just so you remember who you dealin' with
The purest snow, we sellin' white privilege
Designer drugs will turn niggas limitless
Designer clothes, these hoes losing innocence
The book of blow, just know I'm the Genesis
You might also like
As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight?
It's only Monday
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

Just so you remember who you dealin' with
This Pyrex talks, but I'm the ventriloquist
Language different, I'm damn near an immigrant
A song with any of you niggas, I'm disinterested
The needle is sharp, but they ain't shootin' insulin
You missing the point, these drums ain't Timbaland's

Never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fool's Day
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

We fight for the bill, you niggas still chipping in
You Google to death, the shit I get driven in
My boys in the hood is mixed with the menaces
The cane is sugar and cut by Dominicans
Open the box, it's like ten Christmases
My folks in the box is serving life sentences
I live in a world that never leaves witnesses
Just so you remember who you dealin' with
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late8Embed
