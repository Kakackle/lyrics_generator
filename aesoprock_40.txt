185 ContributorsNone Shall Pass Lyrics
I'm— trust me, I'm— trust me, I'm trying to help
I'm— trust me, I'm— trust me, I'm trying to help

Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, "I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt"
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, "That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!"

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall pass

Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, "Wait, let it snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go"
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall pass
You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help
Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
Duty and Death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, "Enough's enough!"
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall pass90Embed

Put one up for Shackle Me Not, clean logic procreation
I did not invent the wheel, I was the crooked spoke adjacent
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience
Y'all catch a thirty-second flash visual
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split ridiculous
Fathom the splicing of first-generation fuck-up
With trickle-down anti-hero smack (Kraken!)
I pace my game for zero hour completion cretin, splash
Duke of early retirement picket dream
American Nightmare hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
If you'd stop following me around the jungle gym
Now it's honor, and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse of my teeming resonance
I promise, tempest-tossed breed with a bleeding conscience
See, the creed accents responsive but my sports divorced the wattage
And I'm sleeping now — wow! —yeah, the settlers laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs (You won't be laughing!)
Then I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
So I triple knot 'em and forgot 'em
His origami dream is beautiful
But man, those wings will never leave the ground
Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down

Slacker-bound intimate tabloid headline with a pulse
Shimmy cross the centerfold, enter dead time engulfed
Divvy crumbs for the better souls
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a lowlife countin' on one hand what he's accomplished
Okay, link me to activism chain activate street sweep
Plug deteriorating cenobite pendragon
I hock spores coursed by the morbid
Spreading of mad men, Alley gospel
Sinking your Lincoln-Log cabin and Charlie Chaplin waddle
I could zig-zag and zig 'em again
For the badge dreams sparkle in my brick wall windows
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Without the wretched; Houston, we have a problem
Attached to the festive batch of city goblins
Who split holiday freaks on a box cut cinema high road bellow
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow
Sort of similar to most backbones at camp Icarus
Where all fiddler crabs congregate and get pampered for bickering
Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman
You only call her a bitch 'cause she won't let you get that pussy
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess
Kiss the speaker wire Peter/pacifism pegging threshold
Stomach full of halo kibbles
Wings span cast black upon vigils
Here to Duck Hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels
I got a friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: "Yeah," but only when I pedaled past him

We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades

And the last shall be
First to the curb with the mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy American nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth

When the weather got cold
Like a lost lamb returning to the fold
And when the outside world recedes from view
It's just a year's supply of make-up

Keeping me alive
There's an envelope with some cash in it
Out by the front door

Used to draw
Hard to admit that I used to draw
Portraiture and the human form
Doodle of a two-headed unicorn—it was soothing
Movin' his arm in a fusion of man-made tools and a muse from beyond
Even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
No name nuisance, stews in a bedroom
Oozing a brand-new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Got a whole grayscale ungluing his world
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross contour, little bit of backlight
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can't imagine the rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York, five peeps and a dog
In a two-bedroom, doing menial jobs
Plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a twenty-year affinity
In rickety condition with an ID crisis
Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's…

They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
Used to paint
Hard to admit that I used to paint
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
It was blooming addiction
Amiss in the pushing of pigment
Book like a tattooed pigskin, look
Pinhead kids of the minute
Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic
And it grew up into linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison, voice of the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
Redo that, move that inward
Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studio strewn with illusion and tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can't imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
In proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two, then three, then a month
And the rest of your life, you beat yourself up
I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive
I let my means of being dissolve
I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety
Has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy
Aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas
Nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's…
Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
I'm getting sick and tired of never understanding
Where is the truth you promised?!30Embed

Look…
Unsigned hype, front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devolved into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher, out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food, manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, can’t lose
Can’t gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor, swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a Tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict?
I mean, I guess it matters to me, I wish it mattered to you

Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles

Check his own breakneck pulse over colors in a drain
That emote sugar skulls in the rain
Flower-eyes melting
Guided by a levee made of bath tiles, tilting
Quarter up and headed for the kill screen
No corner cut, no build team
Only a particularly menacing
Angle perpendicular to everything
Boys room cherry bomb
Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron
Hello! Here’s where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails to bootlegs of Hawkwind
Saw tooth, nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall
A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause
Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
Fade me, failed all basic training
But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
Silhouette,  the god’s last cigarette
Anything less would be ri-god-damn-diculous

77 ContributorsGopher Guts Lyrics
Uh, greasy grimy gopher guts
Poolside, 0 for 1, I don't forget spoons twice
Lukewarm Folgers, mold on his moonpie
Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
My duty go from moving in packs, to sharing food with a cat
To "Ma, it's me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half"
She said "I'll keep you in my prayers," I said "I need to hide a body"
She said "Ok, honey, talk to you on Friday"
Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter, according to the blood-and-water chapter
Weird, who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway?
Probably some surly dad, only child, 30 cats
Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past
Except it doesn't always work like that

Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
Where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn
I told them, "You will grow to be something inventive and electric;
You are healthy, you are special, you are present"
Then I let them go
Oh...

You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
In the mirror sweating pitchers
Who's there: simian or lizard?
As it were there is a disappearing difference
In ambition and material
Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
Move as a godless heathen: black gums, tooth gone, bootleg 'Yukon Cornelius'
I'm a... That's better, here we here we go
Disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill
Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized
Contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized
Check! Never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
It is something he must handle on his own
The windblown way
Wanna win? Don't play

Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark
Where the grapevines climb a convenient barn
I told them, "You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted;
You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded"
Then I let them go
Oh...

I have been completely unable to maintain any semblance of relationship on any level
I have been a bastard to the people who have actively attempted to deliver me from peril
I have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up and lip that kissed me on the temple
I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition that admits it wish its history disassembled
I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance while skimming for a ministry to pretzel
I have been unfairly resentful of those I wish that acted different when the bidding was essential
I have been a terrible communicator prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
I have been my own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels

Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand
Where the low tide showcased a promised land
I told them, "You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive;
You are patient, you are gallant, you are festive"
Then I let them go
Oh

Hobgoblin, shots of hot Strongid
Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage
9 weeks awesome, hides in a slipper
Look in her eye like she might be a wizard
Cold met a cat lady in a parking lot
She got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box
And probably hoarding 40 more in the corners of Fort Knox
Swapped 20 on the spot and cop the warlock
Back at the haunt, found God in the hamper
Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther
Good around misery and golden era samplers
Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers
Bet, more than a pet to worship

104 ContributorsDorks Lyrics
Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
I'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch
Steep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks
Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed
It's a theatre of jumping jellyfish, jealous little sycophants
Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants
Each one separately convinced
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands
Delusion turned the communication to prison camp
You fucking dorks ain't a threat to the cause
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts
Step out the tempest, a measure of what the spectrum involves
Maybe no one cares
Party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
This song's our echolocation up in impregnable fog
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling
God almighty, chop an ivory tower to piano keys
Play your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art
You can't be cooler than the corners
Where you source all your parts
The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark

Party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I view the rattling of sabers like a show to expose
Insecurities exploding in emotional code
When braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross
Corrode a homie 'til his probity is notably ghost
Before the hobby was a job, he was a miniature hell
You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill
But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell
In a whistle and bell-o-rama
Black mollies that dress up like piranha
It's not even compelling melodrama
It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga
I'm very voluntarily persona non grata
You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need
This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed
I'm offin' coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen
Don't make him show the regency what disobedient means

101 ContributorsMystery Fish Lyrics
Tech support, feral army
In a cave on a failed bit of terraforming
Four corners of paranormal
Get shorn for a thermos and pair of thermals
In the warehouse air where his dairy curdles
St. Vincent de Paul trying to square the circle
Circle the source of his power
Foresight born at the corner of Howard on sale
Cherry pick blue in the pale
It's a blue-nose chewin' his tail, losing his coat
Schmoozing a high and a head-rush
Hack up bile over H1N1, and then some
One eye on the breadcrumbs
Other eye on the Drencrom
Other other eye on the income
Good knife and a grin
Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms
Peg leg, smells like Medellin
Wake in the night, make a pipe out of anything
Take 5, take a dive in the cellophane
Turn 5 into 5 6 7 8
Back out, black out somewhere fancy
Shaped like the backseat of Aesop's Camry, dude...
Seat full of chips and sandwich meat from the crypt
In the end if you give an address in a river of piss
Don't question the mystery fish
Just picture shrimp on a pillow of grits
Close your eyes, lick your lips
I'm at the cafe ordering a cup of fresh
Sara gave me 2, I gave one to Rex
He said, "Fools ain't shit plus fuck the pigs
They could never understand what Sumner is"

Curse at a beat cop, doctor a Slurpee
Adopt no Xerxes, fear no moon man
Stay true like a wolf wearing wolf pants
Oooh, never could avoid himself
For long enough to contain or employ as help
And now he look both ways at the asteroid belt
Buzzed, gross and wholly unloved
Still hear an ex in his head yelling, "kiss the ring"
From a fortune to Fisher King
Or from assisted care, blisters in his hair
New day, new diary of disrepair
Soups on, 2-ton crucifix to bear
No shoes, no shirt, no fiscal year
I said hello to Marshall every morn for 6
He yelled at me every time, that's amore, bitch
It only took one tooth to crack the bug juice and chug
Turn a bum to a Sun Tzu, it's bug
Outside home is an open swim
Occultism in the throes of corrosive wind
A cold meal with the ghosts of friends
A whole host of meds, a deal on a Tone Loc cassette
I stepped over a body in the door
I pretend he asleep but it's probably more, God damn
Profound apathy, heart with a crack

97 ContributorsShrunk Lyrics
My first name is a random set of numbers and letters
And other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever
My last name, a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole to a susurrus
It couldn't just be "John Doe" or "Bingo"
My address, a made-up language written out in living glyphs
Lifted from demonic literature and religious text
Telephone, uncovered by purveyors of the ouija
When checked against the CBGB women's room graffiti
My social, a sudoku; my age is obscure
My in-case-of-emergency is in the daisies, chasing birds
Employed by trillionaires with perfect teeth and pores
And people who open doors for the people who open doors
My medical history is a course at SUNY Buffalo
Charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow
Nervous in the service, still; I'm burger meat and purple pills
—"Here." —"Thank you. We'll call your name." —"Sure, you will."

Skipped lunch
I'm shrunk

You pack up all your manias, you're sitting in the waiting room
You're dreaming of arcadia, you're feeling like a baby tooth
Awaiting panacea, channeling your inner Beowulf
In purgatory, just before you pay up to filet yourself and others
In the name of help, coal on a conveyor belt
Into ego death alone, no telephone from Gabriel
I'm half a human, combin' over Home and Garden, stoned
Gold chains over turtleneck, cigars over cologne
A thousand shitty paintings wrapped around a wounded animal
Woo him with the Schubert, he's a future human cannonball
Little fuckers fighting, mother hiding in her Hulu
I'm climbing up the stucco, let's get to the seppuku—uh-oh
That pretty penny turned the prickly into Benji
If you save up all your winnings, then you get to count your blessings
I finally crunched the budget up and punched the button
She called my name out and pushed me into an oven

The fuck?
I'm shrunk

She says, "I'm not your enemy."
I said, "That sounds like something that my enemy would say."
Instead of playing off the chemistry
She said, "You're being difficult." I said, "I'm being guarded
You're a quarter-mil' in debt; I get more guidance from my barber
Look—I'm not good at this; I grew up in a noogie-fest
You built your walls up high or said goodbye to all your Cooky-Puss
Here's one: Every time my telephone buzzes
I see images of hooded riders setting fire to hundreds."
She said, "When you start getting all expressive and symbolic
It's impossible to actualize an honest diagnostic."
I said, "When you start getting all exact and algebraic
I'm reminded it's a racket, not a rehabilitation."
Okay, agree to disagree as grown-ups from opposing clans
Honoring the push and pull, I should've called the Scholomance
Oh well, preservation is a doozy
—"Will you be needing another appointment?" —"Absolutely."
I'm shrunk!5Embed

63 ContributorsBlood Sandwich Lyrics
Yup! Steps up to the plate
Little brother, Little League, '87—he was 8
Rookie season for the skinny slugger newly out of T-ball
Pit against a pitcher with a ripper you could eat off
Church, then a grip of loons run to third first
Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!", nose in her word-search
Seen MILFs like apes on a monolithic bleacher
Into advocating war and peace in lieu of sport and leisure
"Hi, Peggy!" I was 10, chewing on a Sweet Tart
Little brother, left field, queen's guard, mean arm
Knees bent, two out, two on bags
When I caught him staring down at something moving through the grass
Hold up; tagged runner, and the whole cast rotate
Not before he could identify the culprit
Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!" Graham yelling, "Gopher!"
New left fielder give a fuck about a homer
Got a homie, little rodent, head and shoulders out his hovel
No baseball in the bubble, ruh-roh
Parents thought it adorable, the players followed suit
Inning crawling to a close, head coach not amused
Coach seeing red, coach on the diamond
Dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him
When he transverse third, the families turn nervous
The following is a transcript of "Man vs. Vermin"
Here we go: man stands out by a hole
Pest pops up to patrol
Man plays live Whac-a-Mole
In a scene that would try every child as adults
Whoa, pall-bore with a ball mitt
Thrown over the fence, coach hit the bench
Both teams lose, "Good game, good game"
Granny yelling "Go Cubs!" Cubs ain't playing

Neubauten tee, plaid flannel-laden, adolescent art kid
Tony Hawk hair, Skinny Puppy denim
And a record player vomiting Alien Sex Fiend, Peel Sessions
In a Christian home for field testing
It's real youth in the palm of your hand
When your mom thinks Satan is involved in a band
We were buried in the Village Voice, checking who was playing where
Pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear
Five words, like a beacon of light in the mist:
"Ministry live at the Ritz"
It was "Christ Has Risen" to Chris, three loaves, two fish
Miracle of mechanized loops on two-inch
Coming to a theater—he would be there in the flesh
Moms didn't say "No," but she didn't say "Yes"
Cop tickets—ah, the plot thickens
Countdown to ultimate concert experience
Ma still wary: "And why are they called Ministry?
Are they a cult?" Maybe she would probably investigate
Bought a mag with an Al Jourgensen interview
Read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three
That's all—no fair trial
Simply, "You will not be going to the show, and that's final!"
What occurred next were the top of the lungs
Of a son who, unjustly, had lost what he loved
In a moment that would transcend anger to high art
Said, "This is something I am willing to die for!"
Can you even imagine?
A death in the fam from industrial fandom?
Anyway, no body count, no concert
And Chris kicked rocks in his mismatched Converse
My older brother is a funny dude
A lot of funny shit happened to him
We hadn't spoken in a couple moons
I called him last night: "How you doing?"

I see how y'all be trying to front, man
Y'all be fronting, man

Been a bit since Mu died
Been a lot more loss in the wake
I recall thinking, "Someday, someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect"
And I just couldn't fathom blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction
Each claim individual peaks and pockets
Pains and a slew of unique nuances
Nah mean? When you wake up eight years non-responsive
It's a lot to process
Gone from a happier jack-in-the-box
To a package of clogged up chakras
Oh, shazbat! Not the "ever after" he wanted
From the "Once upon a time, dot, dot, dot"
Once upon a time, he was so much more
Than a punchline for his own potshots, ah
Watch the Impossible Kid
Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
If I zoom on out, I can finally admit
It's all been a blur since Mu got sick
None of the subsequent years stood a chance
Whether you his moms or his mans
Whether you his pops or his girl, I was poison
Heart full of canines, head full of voices
Whole life trying to quiet 'em down
Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay
True friendship in a tugboat way
Ae go dark in the face of the fucked
When the fucked was a friend, that was basically done
Into the woods go his alien tongue
It was that or a textbook faking of funk, and I can't
Here go the hindsight:
Eight years been one long blindside
I could pinpoint seven more turns that occurred 'cause he never really healed from the first
Oh, what a world, any hack is a myth
Any dap is a joke, any map is a trick
Any graph is a hoax, ease on down
I'm burning up, I'm bleeding out
Knowing ain't half the battle
That's a bullshit quip written by some asshole
You can own what you are and still sit around stoned in your car
Not doing shit, halfway to nil
Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills
Get out the car, AesYou might also like8Embed

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distress
Composed themselves enough to artfully carve "Zoso" in his desk
They was probably thinking "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!" in they head
With a hell bound arm in a acidy wash
Homemade curfew a thousand o'clock
And the pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
Like a badge of mystique though it technically sucked
Taking the name of the father in vain
On the way to the blade in his locker
Estranged
A switch he lifted from a sibling's skivvy drawer
Who'd branched off into ninja stars
And never knew his shit was sharked to
Here with a higher purpose
And a primal urge of juvenile berserkers
Like Crocea Mors in a arcade drop claw
Gouging a valentine for Miss Othmar
Watch
Capital Zed, slowly maneuver the O
S is the most difficult to control
Finally O
Into the eye of Goliath you go

101 ContributorsCycles to Gehenna Lyrics
Baseheads locally approach all spark plugs
Total disregard for a dying man's shark jump
Post-meridiem pretty tungsten attracts any once-pale horse painted gunmetal black
Face masking, hard-shelled ebony propeller hat
Clubmans, gloved rakes grappling the clutch span
Tuck go the steel toe, metal gate spreading
For the dead-alive that rented parking space 37
2000 out the weekly under "Cycles to Gehenna" gets him floating over 20 buses
Fireproof and festive
Corners like a two-tired tiger so a too-tired rider can accumulate a few excited fibers to assign
Knows no zen in the art of maintenance
Only as the orchestrated patron saint of changing lanes baby
Here is how a great escape goes when you can't take your dead friends names out your phone

Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth

The man-ape translates glam thru the visor
Goes in water lillies
Am-scrays Giger, and man-ray
Crammed in a one-player campaign
Blinker like a hallowed bonfire over Samhain
Span where the praying hands mandate
Bars an extension of the arms
They're mutating instead of being farmed
Tonight beneath a marmalade Venus
Haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us
Going Ford, Jag, Datsun, Corvette, Lotus
All cones you can slalom when your Zorlac's focused
Via mechanical Dartmoor Frankensteined poorly
And sanctioned by a New Yank Yorkee
Who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decopaged suicide flooring
And still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank Charlie
The scarf thank Mom's new hobby, kssssht! copy

More a lonely hearts club at the helm of a magic bullet

I crowbar into the pecking order
The dreck between the whores and Betty Ford-ers
Hug a double yellow spine
Knobby rubber like a rat on a rope
Those little fuckers run on passion alone
This is the product of a DIY inadequate home
Grabbing a cabin in the-fuck-outta-dodge
Actin' a savage in the shadows of Rome
Traffic amassed against insufferable odds
Fashioning gallows out of plastic and bone
I got the motordrome walls of death splintering under me
All-city galvanized bikes white knuckling
Bright light, tunnel kings tuck in the devil

69 Contributors9-5'ers Anthem Lyrics
Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
Via the study of post-adolescent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self prior to Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the half that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self passport our stubbornness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And so on I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs
Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics
Life treats the peasants like
They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
When the clock strikes nine
I'll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players
For the cycle of it
Under a dusted angel harp string Big Brother is watching
My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth
We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
We on some door-to-door now
Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies
For copper pennies for one commanding "Gimme that"
So we can retain baby fat
Make the biter snake bedlam
Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet
Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
Bent barrel one eight zero, U-Turn, squeeze, end it
It's on like it's never been
It's bleeding well
It's bigger than a breadbox
It corrodes my leaky finance
I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge
With a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
The first one slipped
Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
Cuz every dog has its day
At which point, I'll pull it away

We the American working population
Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out
When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pastimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

It's the year of the silkworm
Everything I built burned yesterday
Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve
Elevate the spreading of the silk germ
Trying to weave a web but all that I believe in is dead
Nah brother, it's the year of the jackal
Saddle up on high horse
My torch forced Polaris embarrassed
Shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage
I bought some new sneakers
I just hope my legacy matches
It's the year of the landshark
Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water
They're out there being slaughtered
In meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters
Man it's the year of the Orphan
Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches
Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
Maybe it's the year of the waterbug
Cockroach utter thug specimen
Fury spawned from dreaming of your next of kin
I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in
I've been the object of your ridicule
You've been a bitch lieutenant
God, it's the year of the underpaid employee

Yo, ask her
Hey, Lucy, come here
Lucy, how old are you?
Lucy, come here
Lucy
Hey, Lucy, how old are you?
Lucy!

Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barrettes
City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
There was Joshua, age 10, bully of the block
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
There was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle
She always gave a wave and holler
On her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor
And she drew
Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds
And she drew
Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns
Always said hello to passersby
They'd ask her why she passed her time
Attaching lines to concrete, but she would only smile
Now all the other children living in or near her building
Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
They would say
"Hey, little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?"
Lucy would pause, look, grin and say
"I'm busy, thank you much"
Well, well, one year passed and believe it or not
She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk
And she stopped-
"Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today?"
She said:
"I'm not giving in, I'm finished," and walked away

Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat
Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip
Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
And she drew
Little Bobby who would come to sweep the porch
And she drew
The mailman, delivered everyday at 4
Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
But found it suitable, and she liked it that way
She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit
They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too
So they'd connect on Saturdays to share the pictures that they drew (Look!)
Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door
Just one of the neighbors
Acting nice although she was a strange girl, really
Say, "Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch?"
Lucy would smile and say "I'm busy, thank you much"
And they would make a weird face the second the door shut
And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was
And Lucy knew what people thought but didn't care
'Cause while they spread their rumors through the street
She'd paint another masterpiece
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed

You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, 'cause dreamers always chase but never get it

Lucy was 87, upon her death bed
At the senior home, where she had previously checked in
Traded in the locks and clips for a head rest
Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen
And she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn
Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on
Lucy pinned up a life's worth of pictures on the wall
And sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all
No Rico, he had passed about 5 years back
So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock of nothing
She'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life
Until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside
And she said:
"Look, I've never had a dream in my life
Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued
I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done
So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!"
Well! The nurse jumped back
She'd never heard Lucy even talk
Especially words like that
She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind
Then Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures
And she died
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, 'cause dreamers always chase but never get it

What's that weirdo with the fucking kazoo?

Sharks in the dunk tank, vipers in the garden
Locusts stole the groceries out the local Farmer's Market
All God's critters hold positions
Some are violent, some are victims
Each alive is an equal and vital piston I support
So when the piranhas honor New York
My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport
And while I bring in every dink in the kingdom with open wings
It all boils down to them shit-soaked pigs
The pigs (what), the pigs (what), the dregs of what y'all aim for
The gluttonous muddy stomachs under the pudgy cakehole
Two-track braniac using the food and payroll
To chew up and consume every cookie, crumb, and peso
And place a cloven hoof on the lucrative when convenient
As the bourbon-odor smokers' coughs smolder off the Cohiba
If Noah had the benefit of hindsight on his ship
He could've snatched two unicorns and left behind the motherfucking...

I will gladly feed you to the breed who wants you sacrificed
No pagan or sacrilege, just bacon for scavengers
I will gladly seat you with the chickens, not the passengers

And hunt their truffles in fistfuls, but it was all bells and whistles

Glitzy to the pork ribs, had to gold-leaf the booby traps

As the misery was dormant and divvied in crispy portions
Corporates want to lure him in and whore him. Or does he whore the corparates to expand the more important forums for him
Push the mortar pestle past the ordinary orchard
When the frilly border's faded is the product mine or yours, pig?
Mine, plus I toss a token where I go:
Directly to the worms who shovel shit and yellow snow
This little piggy went to the market with a target
And will subsequently know the armor-piercing forks of farmers
Final words for the finer birds taking notes:

Postcards from the pink bath paint leisure
As a cloaked horse through a stained-glass Saint Peter
Hack faith-healer, cheat death to the very end
Cherry wooden nickels on his specs for the ferrymen
X-O, Zodiac a pentagram expo
Pet Cemetery in electric fresco
Abaddon threshold, flash forged in a galley
With undead orcs pulling oars through the algae
Smash cut to a smoke-bombed quarantine
Guards like, "All signs correlate with sorcery"
It's more a dormant cell of valor as awoken by the smell of sordid power
And defecting shortly after
Fist bump dry land, brackish
Cat nap 15, back to swiss-cheese the flagship, uh
Blue in the menacing grip of a day for which you're manifestly unfit

Final answer "not to be", "not to be" is right!
Next question - to build winged shoes or autophagy
Silk-screen band tees, take apart a VCR
Ringer off, canned peas, cabin fever mi amor
Patently adhering to the chandelier at key-in-door
To usher in the understated anarchy of leisureforce
Led a purple tongue and ratty Caballeros
Up over the black rainbow into the house of mirrors
To become a thousand zeroes, echoing a twisted alchemy
Freak flags, fluttering to circadian free jazz
Sleep apnea, scratching, "bring that beat back"
I doze off, clothes on, nose in the feedbag
Shhh... Om nom, nom, blinds drawn
Compost thrown to the spine pile, bygones
Mangy, intimately spaced pylons
On a plot of inhospitable terrain, "Hi mom!"

Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Night Light, sucka!!!

Put one up for shackle me not clean logic procreation
I did invent the wheel, in a previous generation
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I locate modern halos and pass 'em out to the cavemen
Y'all catch a 30-second flash frame
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split fantastic!
Fathom the splicing of major-league low-life
With anti-hero earthworm mentality – Godzilla!
I pace my game for zero-hour completion
See, a cretin's still a cretin, even speakin' altered moniker
American nightmare lost in the monitor
I'll hold the door open, so you can stagger through
Then send berserker-bred Jukies in after you
It's Gutter, and I spell it with the 'G' I stole from "Get the fuck up!"
Noise crutch stolen wretched refuse of my teeming dumb luck
Still I promise: temperance towards breed still bleeding Amish
See, the freaks sucked out the wattage
While three bears invade the cottage
And I can't sleep now! Yeah, the police'll laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when you're hosted
By the ghost of Christmas past
You won't be laughing when your blow-up doll's got a headache and won't give up the ass
I'ma lay my kicks to rest when I'm impressed
So I staple-gun 'em to my feet
This origami dream is beautiful: pull the tail, watch the wings flap
But you really can't do a thing with that

I'm pretty sure I got a pulse
Plus we Shimmy cross the centerfold, and our night light engulfed
Just let me keep the crumbs (Please!)
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a dead-beat tryin' to make a dollar off a bomb threat
Okay, link me to activism chain, activate wild-style Pluto orbit
Set a course, then push the button
I swallow spores born by the laws
Of a morbid glutton– Alley gospel
I can spot a duck battalion by the Charlie Chaplin waddle (gone)
Zig-zag and zig 'em again
Before the pig can pull a badge out for the lash out
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Like, "Houston, we have a problem: they're buffing the trains the same day the graffiti writers bomb 'em!"
Who split holiday freaks on box-cut cinema high road bellow?
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow!
I'm tryin' to meet the wizard, but a tailgating tin-man holding a oil can won't let a hermit crab break in his new shell-toes
Life's not a bitch: life is a beyotch
Who keeps the villagers circling the marketplace
Out searching for the g-spot
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole – maybe I'm just an asshole!
Kiss the speaker wire (*kiss*)
Sammy Swashbuckler pagan threshhold
Stomach full of diner food, wingspan cast black upon views
Here to help release the rabid hounds or pick apart your mood
I got this friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: "Yeah," and gave him one last look and smashed him
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Swallow up the pieces, spit 'em at your species

50 ContributorsLotta Years Lyrics
The kid that work down at the local Baskin-Robbins
Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar
I watched him relocating pistachio to a waffle
Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel
He asked me what I wanted, I ordered something daft
He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats
Thanks; I like it too but modestly confess
In present company, my coloring is not the main event
Look at that neck
The message is immediate, the guy effs chicks
I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists
So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important
Now some 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar
Got me questioning my morals and their corny pecking order
I should give a shit less
Cherry-No; Whip-Yes

Lotta years
Uh, lotta years

The girl that work down at the local juice place
Got a head full of dreadlocks down to her waist
I watched her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes
My hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great
Some lady orders Maca, compliments the locks
She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop
"It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut 'em, kept 'em
Reattach 'em anytime I want 'em"
My mind's fucking blown
The future is amazing, I feel so fucking old
I bet you clone your pets and ride a hover-board to work
I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first
These kids are running wild, I'm still recovering from church
You should have seen me in the 90s, I could ollie up a curb
You should have seen me in the 80s
I was bumping New Edition, dragging acne into Hades

I was at the gates
Ram's legs, my pizza black, my plants dead
My planet X, I might bleed green
I'm what's under the uncut chia seed
I'm what, what, what, what from the guillotine
A little flea and tick, a little fever dream
A little plead the fifth
Roadkill, I'm off leash
I don't heel and I'm hung from an unkind mobile
It turn one misstep into bonemeal
Look, daybreak, I'm lights out
My kind sleeps upside down
It's sci-fi, red tide, my hi and bye make record time
I go three, two, one, desensitize
No lie, tell death he could get in line
K, hellspawn, I'm no joke
I eat brains, I throw bolts
I know easy prey, I seen broken oaths
I go marching in, I'm all, "Oh-ee-oh"
I know a rodeo from these pony shows
I don't stay for tea, I can't slow the code, I go
Coyote, alone and ghost
I'm in the goddamn smoke, ear, nose, and throat
Ayy, yo, fresh pot, my favorite mug
Aes Rock, my day sucked
Agent of all things deep-sixed
I feel like I was put here to keep the crypt
I get tired of bread, I might eat the rich
I ain't seen a leader, just feeder fish

I'm like Vincent Van with that instant rice
I write cryptograms at all waking hours
I tattoo the mail and all paper towels
I'm on the kitchen walls, I may paint the house
It could breach the yard, it's omega-bound
Game face on dour days, y'all gang-gang's like, "How quaint"
Gangway for that false start vs. freight trains through stalled cars
Shame, shame, shit's so wack, show you back to this moth jar
Death wish from day one, I wake up and it rain blood
Raincheck these fuck shows, I'm donezo, my brain's mush
Drumroll, I might piss straight, loose tooth in my spit shake
Every possible Futurama come trooping out of his pill case
And I ricochet in my steel cage, one still heart and two hill's eyes

Bare hands on this bear trap
For what's staring back in his periscope
A little care package out of Where's Waldo in a rare beige
No fair at all, dyed hair and all
Push foot, I go mach 1, I'm all, "Woosh, woosh"
I don't pussyfoot, I make potholes, my path home is all drop zones
Flash bulbs and strobe lights, road signs with crossbones
Touché from our killjoys who know humanoids are just hit points
Ain't cop that new heat, that newspeak's all pink noise
I'm more mood piece around street food
In my PJs and my snowshoes
About dog fights in those dungeons
And lil' dust-ups in y'all's throne room
It's fun stuff, low moon and my tombstone say, "Hell no"
Hell yeah to more hail storms aboard ships on St. Elmo's

Die already
None defy the one-man walled city
Stone made flesh, veins etched in his hands
88 stance draped in invasive plants
And rain dance unsafely, brace for the supercell
Mutiny or footage for your blooper reel, who can tell
Pours hot tar from the top of the barn
Necktie on his head, condor on his arm
Dog Star in a jar, bordering unsustainable
Mea culpa, mea culpa, maybe I should pray occult
Systematic Catholic or sigil of the Baphomet unraveling
Either way his ID show a snake and skull
Always been a private dude who couldn't keep a tally
Of which lies he told who
Dye his hair, shave, change names and his lazy drawl
Soon enough I will estrange you all
I get ghost

Ghossssst
Now the beat goes!

On Dasher
Half-dead carolers deck a hall, wreck a whole advent calendar
Brother on speakerphone lurking at the Burgerville
Bathrobe hammer toes murdering the curb appeal
Would I be returning or forsaken with the craven and
Carnivorous vegetation that take him for his Steak-umms
I dunno I gotta think about it
Truthfully I don't know which makes me a bigger coward
Either stomach all the hubris, cash in his two cents
Loose lips locked up over a chewed Eucharist
Or, maybe re-appropriate the energy
Holed up, passing the poultry to Hecate
Bullheaded burn out fled his own pedigree
And never better, never would've met your Heaven anyway
Anyway, merry merry go make soup out of bones
Just know when the room go cold
I'm a ghost

For a master of puppets, how sad are his cupboards
Non-dairy creamers, can of last supper
And a runneth over cup full of black tap water
Its a marvel of privacy over pack hunter
Raspberry jelly on his Jesus toast
And turn heather gray sweats into Easter clothes
With no immediately measurable crimewave ice-age

54 ContributorsCatacomb Kids Lyrics
I was a dark, dumb student, no hooky rookie
Day tripping on visions of chickens that looked like R. Crumb drew 'em
They grew him in the royal dirt of Suffolk County's flooring
With the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms
Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles
Fit into the aforementioned or slip through the pinholes
'Zook' slip through the pinholes, crispy the godsender
Who thunk over a quarter plunk to local Mortal Kom vender (What's this?)
Broke the formal squad sensor, root down
Feelers out across the marsh before it was 'awesome cars'
My calling card cavalry cook in a '85 Dodge Ares
Gas for Huntington and back barely
Equipped with super soakers full of piss
And an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit
The kid pilot his ring king dummies to King Kullen
Where he hollered 'fuck the world' from a parking lot in the suburbs
What's this?
A couple spray cans and a little litter
But they'd look at us like swindlers with them Ricky Kasso jitters
So fuck ;em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props
But things will still go bump when them halogens pop
Believe, or be there when it happens
The shaking of the plates off the mantle
The snaking of the flames off the candle
The lady of the lake off the answers
The mating of mistakes 'til they're de-planting cadavers
Now it's rest in peace Lou Peterson whose heater sung disturbingly to
Further re-evaluate your beast of burden's urgency
Damn doggy, good times, thanks
I wrote your name in wet cement by the Brooklyn Banks

Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shovel his meals
Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
So dinner split a lima bean in triplets, pick a winner
It took a couple summers puking pills behind the dumpster
As the largest Pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers
One shoe in a soupy gutter, one shoe in a velvet heaven
Where the mermaids harlem shake up out a lake of melted weapons
What's this?
Dance purty with the hooligan nation
Who are impatiently awaiting zoo-keeper facelift
Extra the days of yore painted similar uber-ape shit
We've merely updated the ancient 8-bit

Who's not as dumb as the tat wit the same scenery

Sparky nails pigs, stigmata for all good sport

And chase cheese fries with Binaca
They had shut the school down early
There were bombs inside the lockers
No concept of the problem, we responded like a snow day
And would clobber shit to flotsam, 'til the cop said it was okay
Okay show the squadrons back into their boxes
Like his Breakfast Club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors
And I walk into the office, coughing awful ether often

Birds of a black
Black feather stick together forever and ever and they always remember you
And all of the shit you do
They pass it to the baby birdies and then they remember too
Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black
Without forgetting the face of the guy in the mask
When you see me baby will you scream or will you laugh?
Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black
Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black
Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black

4 and 20 gory pantone black crows shredding innards
The silhouettes are fencing lefty scissors
Separating horn and hoof as evil's own arpeggiators
They piggy back the tombs of all your deadest friends and neighbors
Buy the getty image, green-cheese moon
Dead-of-winter shit, graveyard tchk! tchk!
Shifter shit, brother was a face card
Crown like a heart-shaped tunnel of woven branches leaning in over his hydro-plaining pace car chase...
Wait up let me isolate the bass more
Gate of god's acre
Aim to rake the snow off each forsaken name here
Supposedly closure'l free the vipers out the bosom
Personally I think it's a bunch of bullshit
Prisoners, tradition is for lovers
God forbid he flip the witch against her coven on some ‘dip or play the dozens‘

Publicly your shadows'll cat call back
Happy to split the button eye and burlap doll
Crack the crypt
Bats eject like cousin death's wing-ed lapdogs ricocheting sonar of the sacrilege
Now let me slow this whole shit down for all you half-goat cowards
I'll even grit my teeth for you
I am so completely off the god-damn grid it's not a question of addressing me
It's "what do these symbols under the dresser mean"
Perhaps a little dash of karma chameleons through the entropy for good/young
Could've used a good lung
Still, proximity to corpses wasn't nothing to the kid but unforgiving science or cinematic horrors
Fast forward, my knee in the gut of a glass coffin
"remember that cow in the dean's office?" seems awkward
And I know your people donated pints to the same pavement but for ash and bone to share a space with strangers seems outrageous, ain't it?
Maybe a dialogue of howls that reshapes the jowls and face somehow relates to whatever you have found among a thousand cloned shrines
Either way - dope stone lion

And they call to let you know your friend is dead in a box
The crows have the tools to get the meat out of the box
Scientific, ritualistic, headstone cold foxes still rot
I'm not gonna rot, no, fuck that snot
You can let them let you rot, man
But I'm not going to watch
I'm not gonna stand atop your plot
I love you friends, but I'm just not
On the other hand if your ashes are scattered in the sea
I will swim in the sea and you'll be with me
And if your shit is scattered at the roots of a tree
I will climb that tree
Everything you think you're hiding shows
In the way you view the graves like a string of tiny thrones
Messages you'd tucked away for keeps has resurfaced to be heard amidst the butchery and beaks
You don't want the passengers to pass
You want each cow taxidermied fatter than the last
Mausoleum lighting is a rush
While it might enhance a silhouette it might expose a crutch
A proud chest puffed to the heavens
Holds nothing if we're cutting past the muscle and the tendon
And we will be cutting past the muscle and the tendon...5Embed

Vita est morte est vita
Life is death is life

Found nothing but the feathers and the skull
On the porch like a present with a bow
Denizen of black earth, gutted and uncoupled from the patchwork
Buried by a 7 year cherub in the backyard
Epitaph and all
Disciple of the cycles and sciences, of birth into fertilized hyacinth
Life into vitamins, invited up to cypresses
A testament to moxie and the miracle of lifelessness
It's tricky when you'd rather rot into the soil as a nutrient
Than navigate this mortal coil in human skin, dig?
The nuances of putrefying jelly hit the levee
When those feathers are a cancer in your bestie
And I pick a ginger gold as fed by a drunken uncle
One from a customer pumping that Sumner blood work
Memitim ascending, settling any high scores
40 meters up with the heart of a high dive horse

In which unruly roots pull you to Lucifer by your shoes I mean, it isn't perfect but don't misconstrue the purpose

An older me would note that whether disposable goldfish
Or theist, we certainly become the earth as equals, in a circle
Unique until the spirit isn't willing
While the flesh is still a staple of the labor force and whistling
It's roadkill evoking emotion his own totem don't
That's a reality you evade or grow to own
Social code broke and a hierarchy to gasp at
Black labs over wack dads on the admat
Tabby over parasite, bats at the parish
A civil war becoming of ungovernable atoms

Crawls out a clawed coffin to huff and puff

My spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun
Troll of the treadmill
Record on the Kessel Run (allegedly)
Edgy from elevenses to Megabucks
Techies with the treble down
This is how we level up
Dead meat, time travel, pressure, and disease
As ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys
The coping mechanism in his LMNOP's
Went from healthy to unhealthy to a hell he never leaves
Cineplex Jesus, curse at the curly fries
Mulling over Chuck D telling me, "Diversify"
I'm at the Supercuts soupin' up the wardrobe
Forecast looking like Ganesh on four phones
"Hello, hello, hello, hello"
Base camp, space camp
Bass in your face fuck, brace for the rain dance
Back in the back of the classroom
After a magical nap in a vacuum

Act natural, whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you

AV cables everywhere, every piece of vinyl scratched
Mentholated Tiger Balm, Aleve with the arthritis cap
Irons and the niacin, iron Quiet Riot mask
Unabashed privacy expanding into simulcast
40 winks, never the same adventure
Refreshing, or the single longest exorcism ever
In the end, you gotta wonder if it's even worth the effort
No stairways into Heaven, you can step into the Escher
Some people have mistaken my allegiance for a weakness
It fucked me up for eons, I wished I was a theist
The type to fake his death then forget he faked his death
Show up on TV, in the crowd at the AVNs, like...

Act natural, whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
(Superfresh)

Hey peace Aesop uh It's Chuck D
Yo man, you keep doin' what you're doin' man
Keep rhymin' through those walls, alright?
Sometimes I feel my heart putrefying inside my body
From diary of dark to piety in the Ponzi
On my better days they mingle and walk off into the poppy
On my worst, the work is overshadowed by the monte
Had to buy some clothes that fit me
And pretend I like agave
With a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley in him
Maybe I should kinda sorta move to Mars
I'm feeling kinda done, too many moving parts
The piss-poor vision is 40 percent floaters
The kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers
The friends you confessed all the dark shit to
Had weaponized the information before we could send roses
And they want a little pearl on how he got to where he at
I can't remember where I am, I feel it's probably a trap
Balk with the lawless, cough in his notes
Walk on even when the walls hug his coat

Act natural, whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you

Dum-diggy, bump Biggie
Til the landlady holler, "Get a haircut, hippie"
The death knell generator entertain a fresh kill
Breath quelled dressed like a bloated sack of dead cells
Shedding, purple tape, purple 'hawk, ape
A single flower through the permafrost
Pick himself and learn to walk, in furry pants
War paint, circling a duralog
Boar face, devil by his side like a service dog
Schlock purist, watch the block burneth
One o'clock prophets in the parking lot at Perkins
The perfect politicians 30 clicks outside of Sturgis
Doggie bag doctors, military deserters
Who still shop surplus and can't hold jobs
I look like I'm wearing a ghillie suit when I'm not
Roll out ghost of Camu on the pegs
Might pedal by the police
Tuff with two F's

Ah fuck that shit look
Can't tell if I'm a little withdrawn
Or dead dog sent to quote/unquote "live on a farm"
The coke bottles tint film noir
Tripping out the milk bar
Poison horchata cup
Milf in the Zip Car
6 arms, 6 hand-styles like ships on scrimshaw
Part Def Jam part Dischord
My wig-picker threw me out of her office
Had to cold turkey 'benzos, summer was awesome
Onion of 'bensis
Summer was awesome
Got brats on the grill
Wormwood in the cauldron
Horse hoof in the dog's mouth
Cholera in the well
Make money periodically vomiting on himself
I read Nat Geo, craft and crack geodes
Lift party hats out of Craft Depot
Unleaded liar blood pumped through his neck
Came down from the mountain
Tuff with 2 F's

Before a player ever met his omega
They were effectively reducing his behavior into data
With plans to build a dais where the
People grow potatoes and cabbage
Don't make him raise the gate between the bettas
In a spectacle displaying the nature of strange neighbors
I paint caves 'til the rage campaign tapers
And show a new crop how he used to moonwalk
Out of breath like a 7-day old balloon dog
I still hang band posters and buy black-lights
Crib decorated like a dorm room at Brandeis
Still pretend I'm gonna build another half-pipe
Nevermind the Ford-era christening and pants size
Man, who could've guessed the future of abominable imagery

Free, forged in various pulp channels
Even his prize horse rides a wolf into battle
Even his blood and body couldn't pick him out a line up
Or his name off the paper
It's Aes pronounced "Why Us?!"
First learned the high art of eyeing a mark
Buying nickels for a dime at the park
I learn to rhyme in New York
I learned to breathe underwater
I learned to walk with a ghost
Adidas reeking of sulfur

Everything you ever stood up for is keeling over

Well, so we meet again
(He said he's grown spiritually
Since the last time we'd spoken)

Ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects
Where the jackals sit and watch the pedagogues clash flesh
Poison function accompanied by six armor-clad
Black horse and buggy mechanisms
Tugged a portion of my severed vision (my severed vision)
The gathering of loose ends in a bucket
With a shoestring budget
Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now)
But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen
Fee fie et cetera
I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin'
I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone
I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin' to paddle back home
I get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention
By eclipsing doom litigants hatched to bash these picket fences
Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering
And when the groom presents the ring
The bride commence the blistering
It's textbook magnificently crude
Prototype king berserker module
Inserted vertical thirst, burst horizontal (treasure)
Treasure, loose cannons span the starboard bow
Of the clipper ship dipped in truth famine pressure (pressure)
Cabin fever meter peggin' ludicrous
Beautiful cartoon troopers
Swallow brutal futility with a teaspoon full of sugar
I rock ready, aim, fire while y'all rock ready, fire, aim
Then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame
Merit badge, marksman, or poacher?
It's all the same (right?)
So I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain

Fertile circle turned fertile crescent via bad investment
Despised every second, but I guess I learned my lesson

Enough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge

Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves
And still my shepherd can't administer
The proper push and pulls
I push the ghouls to man overboard
Pull the bulls onto my sword
And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor
Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar
Got a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, sliiidde over
The recipe's designed to plug the appetite for continuity
By stitching togetherness theme congruents (beautifully)
I peel back hearts and lodge greed physics in the chambers
Cauterize the wound and heads like

Enveloped in a mummy ribbon system

Hey
Warm cider, barn full of spiders
Orange moon, starry night, particle exciters
In a pageant rivaled only by the origin of fire
Now add an organism from alternative environs
A dozen pair of cartoon eyes in a thicket
To see a neophyte get sliced into ribbons
I'm here to pick lice off each other and assimilate
Duck a suit, troubleshoot his moody user interface
True and suckerproof, grew to fully disengage
Float his only vanishing point away from the picture plane
Go to where the radio trails off
And people catch rabies on the way to their mailbox
Under a sideways rain cornering the briar
Still pull a broad sword from a hoarded synthesizer
Nap in a hole in a tree
Cat leaving voles at my feet
Talking Master P, memory foam everything
Jettison the rest and roulette us a new trajectory
Spinal Tap 11, tapping resin out the evergreen
Designated dark horse,  headless independently
Sidewalks end with ponds and frog eggs
Buried bones, and his very own blurry sasquatch vids
Led like field ants to a hot lens
8 o'clock kittens vs cobwebs, fight!

Til the roof is painted Gemini, then set him free
Eat his own body weight in genocide
Came back a decorated dog of war
Who wants more though he currently stuck in the dog door
Additionally, dog isn't even his final form
Just a period, between greenhorn and Hyperion
Peer into the eye of a primordial experience
Portamento warriors in unforgiving wilderness
Borderline ethereal, Noah's Ark room tone
Add a little up high down low too slow
Found acquaintances a pain to babysit
So he gave away his shit and gave 'em all the slip
Now pets hit the ceiling when the wind blows
Fish float belly up songbirds crash into windows
Swizzle apple cider vinegar and dish soap
Suicide flies take dips in the kill zone
Still shuffle thru a stack of old photos
Taken before the varicose verified Chronos
I dunno it feels weird
I'd rather feed an apple to a deer

Could've been voices

Coulda been the rebel yell of something more evolved
Pounding on the front door and standing on the lawn like

[A parable....What is it? Well it's a little story with a lot of truth
An earthly story with a heavenly meaning
Jesus told many parables to grown-ups and children alike
He told them simply and sincerely, in words everyone could understand
So that all might learn the lesson he was trying to teach...]

They were selfish with the helmets on the little bus
'Till brake fluid sewage crippled up the get-retorted nickel punks
Slowly cope but swore his lowly robot vole evoke
Would one day rise in sections to interrogate the Holy Ghost

Holy smokes!
Father, black suit white collar
Kiddie porn dungeon, guns, and three fingers for your daughter's
Caught belly-up, antique Nazi paraphernalia
You cannot pay your bills with holy water and Hail Mary luck 
Shucks fucker, enjoy the Alcatraz shower fun
And mommy's mad I'm cliche generation X agnostic front
It ain't the nifty fate, the 1958, before the New-New Testament-approved Altar-boy fisting rape
And "take me to your leader"
Long as he don't manipulate toddler beaver 
Call me crazy, but I bet that wasn't God's demeanor
Sodom-meter peaking 
But Long Island was Jesus every weekend
Spoon-fed to appease traditional upbringing
Of a Middle Pennsylvania shit-hole where elders movement
Stressed the stellar therapeutic Bible cycle (How?)
One church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much MORE
So the two moved to New York, made babies raised on what they'd SAW
Christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy
But immaculate conception came second to playful goodies
Like laser-tag was way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags
And manger staff as long as Santa ate the cookies 
Grandma was a saint, while he'd paint with snakes and bullies
Said If only you'd memorized your prayers like you did your Kool Gs!
By the time I was old enough to know what religion was
I was Catholicism-numb and truly didn't give a

[This story reminds us of the one Jesus told about people who were kind and
Helpful to others. He said that one day the king would say to these people:
'Come. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you. For when I was hungry you gave me food. When I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.'
But the people asked, when Lord did we see you hungry and feed you?
Or sick or in prison and come to you? and the king answered:
'In as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren
You have done it unto me.']

Just a little bruise in the back of the pews
Acting amused with a mask and them Vatican blues
For in the eyes of the organization I was raised in
Aes' is just another sinning brick in Hell's basement
Cubicle adjacent to the killers and rapists
For what? Drugs and fucking, It's part of growing up
Like cuffs over dumb shits is better than the schools
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Just a lit fuse in the back of the pews
Watching a thousand flavors of the same God feud
I figure ultimate-peace is the common theme
So its a no-brainer "peace" when the blood hit the screen
Got a basic good and evil sensibility born
Good neighbor know a halo wouldn't fit over horns
I'm more science than faith, I'm more karma than bread and booze
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused

I stood before the glittery borders of new radius
In search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet
What I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment
Meets the lust for blood and demerits

Cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky
Collar-pop Jolly Roger die motherfucker die
Apache on a ship shape, in Bristol fashion
Snuck a jammy through the red tape and tiptoed past him
Worm teeth grinding feverishly below
As little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow
So when it's Blackhawk over the glass walk
They surface up through the cash crops
With clippers for your belly-up mascots and never dine alone
Meanwhile, back at sea level, it was home by home zone for zone
Bloom County's homeless riot for home ownership
I hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads
I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb
As opposed to the loaded nose who pray Armageddon is numb
And that's unevenly rendered
To those who grew up thinking faith was a surrender of reason
But not a reason to surrender
Catch the Liberty Fire's catalog
Forty torched orchids and citronella for Algernon
Don and Vagabond alike repent
This shit should have been Beta burns Babylon, the end

Nothing says charm like an armored car
Taking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bazaar
We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts
And march through the gauntlet of car alarms
No harps, no delusions of losing with something prettier
Than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears
But we can run with scissors through the city fair
Or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs
Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark
Where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy Clarks
These are the vices of the p-noid bastards
Who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest
But crews lose lunches by the hundreds
Lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing
Humming keep your mouth closed
Keep your cows cloned, go
I am the pulse of this fucking town homes know
My what a convenient embargo
At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from
The too-far-gone kicks, still in the box
Fix, still in the pill in his sock
Chilling, gill in the slop and a million watch Gideon scribes
But once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide
And that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish
While profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes

The mobile infantry is so postal
Coast into the quotient provoking the local Pistol Pete
Choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens
Smokey little pile of bloody pulp and co-dependencies
Dopey, no surrender, bender in effect
Sole defenders of the longest night New York had never slept
And there were jumping jacks and whistlers over Christmas
Like Rockets From The Crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference
I step in Hog Heaven, stony, with no weapons
Pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers
Who broadcast eighty million versions of the sermon
For that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains
Pale, Arcadian moon, high-definition, flat plasma
IMAX, city-wide transfer
Artificial Einstein-Rosen out the tenement
Ease into the Xanadu, let it hammer the tension out
I'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal
Monitor face to the wall opposite
U.F.O.'s and locusts sing the same old song
While the Weathermen get retarded as the day is long

I am a man who uses the techniques of a bat to navigate...

Can’t motherfuck a motherfucker
From the underfunded klutz who never undercut the butcher
The pick-a-booger-at-your-wake is bumping "I'm your pusher"
Also at your wake, juvenile intruders at the gate
Brooding over waking history that bubbles
From the blinking 12s of VCRs and Microwaves
Like time machines for shrinking elders
Rifling through their recipe, carrots, onions, celery
What unique amalgam of piss and repugnant energy
Spun him out of the '70s, to beeline for dessert?
Fire-eater trying to keep it on the green side of the dirt
This is tea-time with the worst
Geriatrics on the decline of berserk
Back in my day we were three times more alert
Now I go through my old clothing
Trying to find nostalgic threads to sell
Walk away feeling like I should have never dressed myself
Sincerely I was never on the cutting edge, my hand was on the hilt
You’re free to build with the other end
Shriek into the vacuum if in spite of your accomplishments
You wake up feeling empty like Houdini’s grave probably is
Volley with the quintessential digital ager, I'm offended by everything
My opinions come in a manger, oh boy
Depreciating since they drove me off the lot
Still into ghost stories and pot and the classic coconut bra
Procedural crime drama shows with holes in the plot
And reminding clones there’s more to coping
Than a nose full of snot
Ah, old pros throw 'bows to the 808
You couldn't throw a rope over a baby gate
Bishop to queen 4 in Damn Daniels under ram skulls
Plan for cloudy with a chance of anvils
Fever dreams of padded cells and jagged pills in frozen pipes
Socialites from pageant hell with plastic smiles and robot eyes
I’m hoping you all grow into the sentience you assume
As your moment of self-reflection is a moment for me too
Look, with the steel chair, sure to serve the veal rare
Brush up your evasion and basic tactical field care
I was on that constant futile rage before the internet
I been ignored for longer than you’ve been interested
The posse promise you nobody feels threatened by a scarecrow covered in crows who feel welcomed
That’s like hellions thinking Hell is just OK but needs some polish
It helps to know intimidation’s all about the optics
Come duck a bounty, it's a hoot, Suffolk County, it's a zoo
Puppy chow and bitches brew, it's not exactly chicken soup
It’s heavy lifters lifting, it’s ginseng on his whistling
It’s we don’t find the flippancy convincing, two for flinching
Older yeller, never knew a no-kill shelter in his doggie days
Now I draw my neighbors over kouign-amanns and coffee stains
A walled and whirling urchin, more observant than audacious
I document the great unwashed and curse in Lithuanian
For a gallery of grifters channeling Sid’s action figures grafted
With his little sister’s after markers, glue, and scissors
It’s trippy, the truth and fiction moving to a center
Maybe it’s weirder they’ve never been photographed together
Sometimes the stomach disappears from under a retreating lens
And patterns of a need to please abusive folk reveal themselves
I’m peeling back the layers, I’m sneaking past the lasers
I’m a lover, I’m a fighter, I’m a seed to blackened acres
The dogs I think are following me home are out to kill me
Your music makes a motherfucker wanna move to Elm Street
Rejection of the spirit by the body at your service
If you mess-up every friendship come get swept up in the current
Here, wheels fall off of cars when they see him
Seas part, green trees march out of Eden
I'm known to eat the heart and keep the archery uneven
Are you starting to be part of the kinesis?

At night I wear a wolf's head on my regular head
Consider an irregular character sketch
Food hoarder, communes with the flora
Computes in cahoots with beauty and brute force
I've got a brand new normal at a thirty in New York, plus
Years at the fire pulling portions out of corn husks
Never mind time on the short bus
Terrifying errant knights thwarting any motherfucking fork tongued-sport
Agita flashing the hind molars, though his body less a weapon more a bag of lipomas
Over medium, treat skin-tags like scratch-offs
Rap like black-ops, rappers like lap dogs
He got the rad moves, catty alpha rat-proof (wait)
Twenty-sided die at the crap-shoot (wait)
Looking for a black hole to casually collapse through
Try aisle nine by the cat food

Ooh wee, do we roast in a bilge, when the skinny from afar is "Thar be gold in them hills"
Time better let a couple truths decay, or somebody going to rue the day
Check, check, check

58 ContributorsCommencement (at the Obedience Academy) Lyrics
I fell asleep again
I wasn't ready for it
Yo

The harvest appeared less plentiful than last season
I imagine sloppy seed handling evoked a stroke of tardy planting
And the crops we'd have harnessed mid-November
Had only brushed the blossom bracket
Then soon sacrificed lives to icicle jackets when the frost hit
I sunk to find the warmth beneath the mosses
With a plan to tunnel past after the rains have run their courses
But alas, the portraits of these frostbit corpses tortured in the grass
Offered this torch supporter one tall glass of nauseous
And I'm asking you: Why's the spy supply hiding in strangers
When they know atop the food chains I could spot biters for acres?
Now be gracious, these minstrels turn a bully cycle civil
By dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels
The upbringing of self-styled freedom brigade investors
And their studies connecting one hit wonders with dust collectors
Puts it down
It's down beneath your sappy sing-a-longs
Let's take it further down, we'll let Dante decide which ring I'm on
Nova
The elders took positions and the fans marched
Parched, plain and steamed
Hawking the rain in my canteen
Now I'm like point:
I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads
Counterpoint:
During my famine I never got broke your bread
Well, equation of intrigue, yes, yes
Lemme fence sit for a bit
These tense lips need soaking before I hand out tokens
Shut the fuck up
Drama like kabuki with a heart of dirt
Skull fucked cross bones hence my birth
It hurts

I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine
But it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning

Crowning the glory of our advance
Fire ants to water beetles
These Freemasons adjacent to pacing pins and needles
Pupil turned pedagogue, benediction to my dream
Beaming a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine
Check it
I'll pluck the petals off a classic blood rose one at a time
Gripping the stem in the right; invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline
It's a metaphor for nighttime
Ante up the slight cost of exhaustion
To salute the moon above paradise lost and you're a spectator, stringent
Inch by sacred inch shoveling coal into my earthworm soul
(You should know!)
Burrow up through the dirt with bloody digit
Lick my knuckles clean
Noting the corporate clusters holding hands
'round the abode of the damned
Now what's your poison?
Starlight in a maser with a nicotine chaser
Sip it clean, savor the taste to sit and dream later:
The eyelids pivot back upon the hinges
20 miles across the glassy eyed window of wonders to passers by
Now I'm 6 foot 4 with a 6-floor walk up just to recline
With no free time. The alarm storms at nine
My daytime's on some, 'Yes, sir. Ok, sir. Right away sir
Sir, do you mind if I breathe, sir?
Oh you do? Well excuse me, sir, fuck you.'
I breathe slow
I run in with these fantastic amalgams
Painting casket-bound careers to peers gunning with classic albums
Security's the javelin, catch it
Labor
Clocked in in '76 and haven't clocked out ever since
Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I milk my habitat for almost everything I want
Sometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut
Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine
But it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning

Feel it, it's like that5Embed

48 ContributorsDefender Lyrics
Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat
Keep the pets inside, notify your contacts

New Salem
Brave new voodoo
Wave a witch hammer in a haven for the woo woo
I'm paper china dinner, mostly picking at my stitches
The bloody hair, bad code, bunny ears, dad jokes
Bitch about Lamictal to whichever vixen listen
The skin rash, the schism, a million rash decisions
In truth, he had a capital T terrible 2 days
That chewed his plumage to the root
And proved a prequel to malaise
A feud he knew was brewing blew up in his face
He'd been replaying the scenario for days
With the variables replaced
Meh
Loser in the sky with more diamonds than the carpet from the Shining
Part riot, part Orion
We jarred a lot of lightning up
Shook a turkey leg or 10
Maybe we deserve a day of rest
Not to mention...

Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat
Check your trash can lids, notify your comrades
I said, "I'll take first watch"
1 AM defend the whole block
(1 A M)

The coyotes, summon the ghosts of blown diodes
Open and moving like a luchador with no eyeholes
Fried while the pipes froze, life goes Lovecraft
Christ-pose, sitting on invisible hubcaps, up
Call Alex back, daggers in the basil patch
Tell him maybe less badminton more Scrabble Dash
Less Jarts more Rummikub
Whatever keep the scallywags wrapped up in the subterfuge
Gussied up, guarded, and wearing the same armor as the night he argued 'til he dapped his mans up at departures
I could drive into a lake of fire
Pay the piper COD
Aware the pot and kettle shop a little toxin equally at least
It's probably more the kid than the kid
Either way a vital widget in the system is sick
A sea of symptoms in the hinges hit the room all at once
All I can do is plug the roof with my gum
For now I gotta...
Call Alex back, coyotes in the castle grass
Tell him, "Maybe less freeze tag, more hack-n-slash"
I said, "I'll take first watch"
1 AM defend the whole block
(1 A M)

So a third party, who is incidentally not Alex
Seen a black bear catawampus by the college campus
Soon the safety propaganda clamps breeds on leashes
No compost, bird seed out of feeders
Make a lot of noise when you frolic under the ether
Keep a hand on the pepper spray
Sneakers on the detour
They're more scared of you than you them
Although, one of us chews limbs, and one has 2 chins
So leave a couple messages, vomit a couple dollar bills
Guilty in the window romanticizing the potters field
Not sorry, but I never really was a leader
Found money in the speaker, bought lower Manhattan pizza
You meet a few exceedingly forsaken
Sit around the cooler refusing domestication
Then a couple decades pass and you can't even find the wavelength you was on when you was running 1 AM
By the way...
A third party, who was incidentally not Alex
Seen a bear put a thousand chickens in a pot with carrots
I said, "I'll take first watch"
1 AM defend the whole block4Embed

This is my friend Tony
He's pretty cool, although he's not always so smart

And then they were eight
Just like that, just like that...
(Bring back Pluto, back-back Pluto)
(Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto)

In the beginning it was Large Marge sent me, I'm bent
Empty the rent if you can double park the garbage barge gently
The moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house
And Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers sold him out
Close your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma
Clouds, Solar boy elope with couch ogling older Polaroids
Motor mouth, chauffeur the golden molar toy
Gophers yoke a fish out of water, he grows lungs and multiplies
Idle when soldering a perfect union
It is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends
So if mutiny ensues the aloof is assumed nuisance
The clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps
Maroon the traitors expecting acres of edelweiss
Who later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives
I show up late looking project grizzly
Two bowies, a third for throwing and accomplish dickweed
Nothing, nada, nill, I stuff a lot of pill to gut
What's the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks?
I'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood
But if I'm not! (Hmm?)
Fuck it, plug him, warpy got his goddamned groove back
Jet-setting on spec with a dead yeti on the roof rack
And miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia
Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation
And I walk like early man, freak a little witch hunt
Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma
The malformed oddities among sovereignty's normal
Shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you

All I thought of was the cloven-hooved
And how they clip-clip-clop over the woven roofs
With a nose for commotion and stolen goods

(Bring back Pluto, back-back Pluto)
(Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto)
They're all-they're gonna want his milk money next

Stare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and crow
Authoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone
All the town sickly know the Coke machine as home
Where they sit and hope the Ovaltine that noble's drink is strong
Couples only roller rink with soul to kiss your chicken noodle
Before they wiggle mittens through the pillory to ridicule
And you can hear the iron maidens lock
Or see the town criers ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck
A is up early, ring and run thank you much
Document a little of that underbelly bang for buck
Hey I walk as the hype of the city gossip
Meaning every dumpster diver's gotta vomit up a comment like
Um you ain't shit, this ain't ill
This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still
This a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build
Cause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell
Babylon goggles, gawk for the galvatron coppers
Tugboat salvage all fossils
I'll be shepherd when the whirlybirds deny the lepers doctors
If I'm not (Hmm?)
Fuck it, the terrible metal hacking seasons's
As American as ski up off a plastic d-cup
You'd think Charlie Brown was Weathermen
How I zig-zag around these yellow backs for peanuts
In the baggy stomach lining attached to the bums in hiding
Sits the morals, every outing would slide to refine his grinding
When the freakishly disfigured have been triggered to surround you
You will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose
All I thought of was the cloven-hooved
And how they clip-clip-clop over the woven roofs
With a nose for commotion and stolen goods
Now tell me, what the fuck am I supposed to do?

62 ContributorsTetra LyricsDon't fool with his cool

I turn a staff to a snake and back, evade crack
Shake a 5150 in shades and a fake stache
Dirtbike made of 5 worse bikes, uphill
Tabletop frames on dutch tilt, crush kill
Maker bot coin-op arcade punk
Talkin’ arcane science, dark age pulp
Four eyes carb face, Bar-Kays iron on
Pork rinds orangeade, Jarred brains die alone
No Mulligans, crow bars bird cage
Cold, colonize Mars on Earth day
And surface from the cellar door like worms into the petrichor
Messenger, better yet a vessel for a Tetris score
Zilch, cowabunga homies call me “press ignore”
Devastating energy exploding off his Tesla coil
Farm bated breath and tempermental tremors
That taught a man to wave with 10 percent of his fingers
And I never lost tic tac toe to a live chicken
For the footage, I’m off cam dynamite fishin’
For diamondback rattles in his holy grail
Evoke colony collapse via gross betrayal
3 wolf moon shirt, two shoes one sock
Wore the same hoodie everyday like Mumm-Ra
Buh-dum-bum, follow the regenerated rebel flesh
Out of sorts, out of water, suicidal tetrafish
Who stood by the conviction in his we should be together less forevermore
Before we are the severed heads of civil war
Invasive radio ricochet off the silver foil
Trash can fire looking for a kill to grill or spoil
Quickly, purveyors of fine hijinks
I know, this is why we can’t have nice things
I prefer to skip the pleasantries
Flip the diner table, dip in time for final jeopardy
You might also likeNo shit
Oh and don’t fool with his cool
Ma, can we get a pool?
… Is that a no?

Okay, magpies, Hoarders, and allied forces
Who lick zig-zags being dragged by horses
Transcribe stories in patterns of pins dropping
Skinned boars and exaggerated limb-lopping
Slow Mozart, no I’ve never heard of knocking
Might’ve burst in on it, splits or skin popping
Opt out, sober on the eve of no saints day
Locate and aim for the token propane tank
Bang! Followed from a pulling of hair
To a homecoming sullied by a skull on a spear
It spun a human resources issue to public affair
Reciprocity is a pestilent compulsion to bear
And ultimately unfulfilling, concurrently that rigid upper lip and grudge are crippling
The wonder twins of bitching
Armchair hater, I wouldn’t piss on your coffin
But when I see your picture I draw dicks on it
The Ozone breakaway tux
Holds chicken wire ribs and paper mache guts
Pipe cleaner mustache, rope hands google eyes
Macaroni gas face, no plan to humanize
You are now rockin’ with the worst
Nothing up his sleeve, nothing here is what it seems
Paranormal weather, mysteriously disappearing bees
Not to mention the collateral delirium it breeds
Jeez, forgive him any dicey past
He from a tiny town called Deaths Icy Grasp
And he don't get out much, but when he do it's Beatlemania
Do not be asleep at the feet of his feelers radius
Too charitable, offerin’ the average joe some real estate
Between the Big Mouth Billy Bass and jackalope
Cozy in a moment of bliss
Snatch the food off your plate, snatch a goat off a bridge

51 ContributorsFive Fingers Lyrics
Take-take the medicine, tastes great
Got the key to the city, I’m wake-baked
Way before the media shitting or 12 zip of ganked paint
The origin of a thievery leader will take place
Two coke bottles adorn the rogue toddler
Grapple a refrigerator, gaffle a Nilla Wafer
And no role model provoke him to shift focus
Cause he noticed that a cookie tastes better when it's stolen
Kids got the darnedest quirks
So 11's arms skip jars for his momma's purse
And bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn
Which he kept in a box in the yard
And the bark isn't carved from a klepto-anthem
But a klepto-tangent prefaced the grand canvas
Dance to the dirge, stand up
Celebrate the natural need to own what ain't earned
See it rolls off the tongue
Like a smoke ring rolls off a lung 'til it's done
Ready, set, kept petty theft on a post-it
Later apply the motives to a moment on some grown shit
"Hey, you with the sharpie and BM!"
Did you foreplay the GM, or you carpe the diem?
Whore play the porn game, fornicate the sure way to freedom
Or correlate with the swordplay and heathens?
Trickery and backtalk, fresh outta high school
On the prickly catwalk of the modern grind slide rule
Every last number in its history
Got is own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory
Thanks, bathe in a bottle of your finest
Tackleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds
Before the hell appears to put the chemi in the climate
Get your money from the richest, get your pussy from the flyest

Slow and low, do or die stuck, two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)
One by one like little confused penguins
Larceny's yes-men ooze for used weapons
Like a bitter little burglar jaded up out the bucket seat
Is dumb enough to feel like the public owe him a fucking thing
Nope, gotta configure the five finger
So the hot-wired vehicular skill is applicable
If an eye's on the prize and the itch ain't flushed
I hope the fruits of your labor outlive the initial rush, like
Step on the abysmal cusp
With matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fuck
Then incubate the mutt baby through his stigma's crutch
Like he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums
And this is certified milk by the New York Department of Skullduggery
Shoplift quicker than your shutter speed, click!
Missed, he dipped with dumb cutlery
In and out of muddy river water 'til the rudder bleed
Skip around the money pillar, color me bunny killer
Hovering where the mother feed, gutter greed king
And a crummy motherfucker breed fuck with me
It go knock knock rummy at a bruckner speed
The seed's all growns up playing grown people games
Evil aims grown, encompass the whole steeple chase
Grip, mitigate the master plan
So when the workers are asleep, riffraff expands
Yes a pig is a cop, but gotta fill up the flock
So when I rake in the bacon I hope the kiddies'll watch
I hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked
Cause opportunity's fickle, after it trickle it stop
Capture the flag, drag that crass little bastard
Flat through the hazmat and glass
Laugh when he ask for it back; scratch that:
Welcome to the magic in a basket of cash
Slow and low, do or die calm, suicide king in the tuck of the palm
Slow and low, do or die stuck, two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...

68 ContributorsSave Yourself Lyrics
"Chill with that ill behavior!"
"Chill with that ill, ill behavior!"

Pull the pin out, sheep creep in wolf garb
Fronted by the Hail Mary parry lunge mix
Kill the populace for stability, jeopardy's a stickler
It's bob and weave amalgam played the falcon to your fixture
I branch out, arms flailing backwards
Whaling upon a tidy sound circuit, slightly foul Gershwin
With a bed of nails and drum lust, plus disgusting service
Working in shifts opposite the asbestos brain furnace
I be the now observatory: eye, ear, antenna feeler
Spitting like a dragon with a similar demeanor
Stood innocent bystand, witness the die-hard fans turn Rip Van
In the poppy fields of N.Y.'s orchestrated brick gauntlet
Now I'm thinking, "Who am I?" Jabberwocky Superfly, bent left
Pushing war without the ten step cushion, and what? (What?)
I plan to hold this B-positive sacred in these golden veins
Until the day I die from grimace overload
It's shock (It's shock)
Treatment offered by the weekend
Dystopia getaway, let's display the sequence, it goes:
One for the heartless thievery turning my guardian angel harpless
And the rest to sweep the mess under the carpet (Under the carpet)
I drag a yellow taxi meter
Behind every measure and charge cats for labeling me shepherd
"That'll be 6.50 plus tip, darling
I take cash, credit, check, money-order, gold and cigarette cartons"
Got caught up in the universe trying to zoom in on stardom
Forgot the passion plus the hatred, both were based in Carbon
Next time you wanna be a hero, try saving something other than hip-hop
And maybe hip-hop'll save you from the pit-stop
Kill 'em all, yield
(Naw, man, it wasn't me it was Holden Caulfield, brother
I just read and pulled the trigger)
Oh God, well leave me to tiptoe past the pearly gates
Capture the halo, jet back to base, step
Fast to chase the bad taste of jet lag and waste slackers
There ain't nothing broken, where you at?
The pistons pump perfect, where you at?
The bass tone is Merlin, where you at?
The services of urgent working surgeons
Purging formulas looking for an improper cause is whack

What are you saving, honestly? (Honestly, honestly)
What are you saving, honestly? (Honestly, no honestly)
What are you saving, honestly? (Damn)
Promise me you gon' shut the fuck up and recognize
What you holdin ain't really broken

I don't flick needles like my sick friend
I don't march like Beetle Bailey through a quick trend
I don't frequent church's steeples on my weekend
And I don't comment if you formulate a weak Zen
All I ever really wanted was a getaway
I'mma take a chance by letting a rook slide forward out of my hands
I cannot agree to follow a leader along a borderline
Of war without a reason for the "ready, aim, score."
Bring out your dead, we can put 'em in a pile
And burn 'em with the novels for the kiddies to admire
Kill the ones that speak from a different life brew?
I'd rather kill the noisemaker that separated the two

Okay, welcome to the Kamikaze bottle rocket cockpit
Live by the icy cold hand of bad intention youth blender
Oh, yeah, I'll let God warm the bench for now
But I'll ascend to spin y'all dizzy
(And for the record I'm bringing my TV with me)
It goes: let the commoners speak publicly
Then disperse eye jammies for cats that swear by third pupil
But can't see past the loophole
Motherfucker, my word is born like Siamese triplets
With doctor, lawyer, rocket scientist promise
(Let 'em grow leisurely)
Hey Mom, I'mma fix whatever I broke along this path
Once my spiel's perfected, I'mma save you a seat in the front row
Of Aesop Rock's twelve steps to shut the fuck up seminar
And when all these bickering crowds turn silent you gon' be proud
I tack hacks to the (backboard)
Honesty's a (patchcord)
Fury's far from (obsolete)
Serenity's a (crack whore)
Raw caricature of mayhem standard, branded by the labor
With a thousand reasons to end this for every one of you saviors
Saw the brightest burst ironically wandering the vacant stage
Gave it a pound for burning where bunk ratio's engaged
Keep me posted as to when you grasp something mature to
Sit and sulk about mister, and I'll consider picking up your record

The Orphanage, they ain't got nothin' to save
The Overground, man they ain't got nothin' to save
Def Jux, they ain't got nothin' to save
The Atoms Family, they ain't got nothin' to save
Weightless, they ain't got nothin' to save
