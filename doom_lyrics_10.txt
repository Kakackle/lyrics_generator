Things take a turn for the worse
Send him back where he came from
We got shots fired down the street

Ba-di-yahhhh
Alright, steady
Ba-di-yah, ba-di-yah
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded then- (Ahem)

Good to the last drop niglets
Hood 'til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses' dicks or higher
Beatwalkers still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth, play alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them nosy Federales, yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your Nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell get lighted on sight
The ringer's on a need-to-know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you're on your own, acted alone
Back home, your fam'll be provided for while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice, bring back eyes, fingers, toes and pictures
Send copies to those who singin' the blues
Mothers and fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send them a message, let them P.O.W.'s go
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty
A new way to let the shots spray
A few drops a day, double espresso, D.A. latte
No smell nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor paid to get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stresses
A long list of C.O.'s names and addresses
A fake judge with many years on the bench
That sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched
The whole system scared in doubt with a fear stench
And she was tortured, some say post-mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught him
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part when Terminator killed Tookie
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded, son, then shit
Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud, red flood (Villain!)

One of the things we ran into the unknown
We we couldn't get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to
And once we did, finally pull the door and breach the interior door
There's a man trapped inside of it
Basically that man trap is a cage
'Fore we run in, we're stuck in there and they can shoot us
While we're just, we're stuck in a cage

Living off borrowed time, the clock tick faster
That'd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
Dick Dastardly and Muttley with sick laughter
A gun fight and they come to cut the mixmaster
I-C-E cold, nice to be old
Y2G stee twice to threefold
He sold scrolls, lo and behold
Know who's the illest ever like the greatest story told
Keep your glory, gold and glitter
For half, half of his niggas'll take him out the picture
The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta
Villain: a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare
Whеn he have the mic, it's likе the place get like: "Aw, yeah!"
It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
Just keep ya eye out, like "Aye, aye, captain"
Is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody ain't hear it?
And can they testify from in the spirit? (Nah)
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got "Ooh, Lord"s
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
Either that or either one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it (Yuck)
It's like the end to the means
Fucked type of message that sends to the fiends
That's why he bring his own needles
And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
Slip like Freudian
Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion

One more beer
And I'll take you all
All of you

Banned from all bars
The man with seven scars

Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fell
Sunday in the ATL and I'm all outta ale
Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail
Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell?
Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well
Since last week, the bootlegger been in jail
If all else fail, inhale the L
Makin' sure they can't see your sale via snail mail
Mind like a sewer, servin' rhyme on a skewer
DOOM'll step to a fine dime like he knew her
"My black sister!" She said, "Step back!" before he kissed her
She did the dipper and the smack just missed her
There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger
99% of rap's just a friendly listener
I'm like, "These dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all"
Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball
Y'all know it's time for the end when the day come
Buy a album, get rudely insulted over fake drums
Same CDs you get for free, you break 'em
Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like Steak-umm
Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paprika?
One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker
Every week or so, peeked out the lab though, eureka!
A technique to keep somethin' uniquer in ya speaker
For yo' information, I didn't do the beat, y'all
It ain't my fault if she didn't move her feet at all
Skeeter, robbed Peter to pay Paul
So he could trick it on Mary so she can play ball

Drink it all fast and make you haul ass slowly

Yo, G, remind me to remember what you told me
Whoever don't feel him, feel balls like a goalie

One for the money, two for the better green
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
Told the knock-kneed ghetto queen, "Get the head fiend"
Tell him it's from Medellin and use oxyacetylene
Who needs airplay? It's all just hearsay
Leave a wig like it was having a bad hair day
Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret
He said, "Shasta, it turns to formaldehyde faster"
When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily
One night, she tried to flail me with her ukulele
Pack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat
With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat

They better have my skrilla

Yeah, that's right

This is real shit
This shit come on right after Hart to Hart y'all
No doubt, seven o'clock Fantasy Island
This episode is "Death to a Brooklyn Man"
And this is Tony's Angels, aiyyo

It was three white bitches who worked for Tony Starks
Undercover agents, far beyond narcs
Amazed by their beauty marks, Wonder Woman bracelets
Knee-high boots that was made by Clarks
My dick got hard at how they spoke and shit
Every language was music to the kid as if
I was modern day King Midas
Doreen, Skye and Kelly, Starky's Angels, Shaolin's finest
Though it happened in the streets of Brooklyn
Plus I played the whip real low cause my face was woofin'
My Angels jetted out of Albee Square, gun out, wrap in their hair
Kinda crowded so they clapped in the air
Chased a nigga down block for block, squeezing Glocks
These mommies real angels, took one off his top
He's a rapist, murderer, convict, burglar
The more they ran, the more their skirts got dirtier
Sending shots like check day, FedEx expressway
Boom bow bing, you heard the gunplay
"Who shot that duck out the window", Mr. Lee said
"Three pay now, you fucking weed head"
We can stop the finest suspect, he's dead
Then I pulled up, "Come on girls to Club Med"

Three's Company: "Family Jewels"

Two brown sisters assisted the Villain, DOOM
He woke up stoked like they was still in the room
Freed his right arm and leg, it was more like a sweep
Release his other leg, arm, head and rose to his feet
Staggering except for the socks and mask, naked
Threw on the boxers, searching for the Treo, checkin'
For the keys, the dough, a robbery expected
Yet nothing obvious was missing, recollected
Now why Hollywood hotties stepped in Giuseppe Zanotti's
Personnel nurses, Chanel purses, CLK shottie
Chasing Patrice with Thai iced teas
She drive while nice to veggie fried rice spicy
Told them both, "I don't feel so well, my belly
Spin me down Melrose, drive me to the telly
Y'all go head and get the dutches, be back, copy"
Feeling woozy, no uzi, who's he see in the lobby
(Peace) Peace, pizza man (Change a hundred) stopped and looked
Whoops, left the knot in her pocket book
Wasn't the juks but too careless fearless
Got to the room and fell flat out on the terrace
The question remains who bound and gagged him
That's when they found the empty pack of black Magnum
Villains skied a gram on the street, fifty G
The part of Mr. Roper was played by Mr. T
I'm Mr. T, fuck Charlie
Like I was sayin' (True story) I'm Mr. T
Kelly, you gon' give me some pussy?
You know what you gon' do (Janet was dark-skinned)
You too Dorine, your little fat ass can't get away neither and shit
Kristy was brown-skinned
Uh-huh, that's right, yeah I'ma call them Theodore niggas
SWAT team on alert and shit
Uh-huh, yeah, that's right, Skye you can't hide baby
You got the best head nigga, word up
The mask was chromed out
This real Angel shit, y'all my bitches
Toney Bosley in this bitch, nigga
Word up, gimme back my boots
Theodore

SOCIALLY DISABLED, REFUSE TO PLAY THE GAME

ATTEMPTS OF INTERACTION FAIL WITHOUT A HOPE
ACCEPTANCE FADES AWAY, NO COMMON GROUND IN SIGHT
FOREVER OUT OF PLACE, GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT
ANTISOCIAL (x4)
I'LL NEVER BE A PART OF IT
FOREVER BE APART FROM IT
ALWAYS ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING TO FIT IN
ANTI ACCEPTANCE, TO BE DIFFERENT IS A "SIN"
SOCIALLY CORNERED, TRAPPED WITHOUT A CHOICE

NO FUCKING VOICE
